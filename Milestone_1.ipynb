      "['sometimes the power of christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things you do not need to believe in the holy trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others the simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need one congregation in ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on christmas eve the pastor at grand lake united methodist church in celina ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of jesus for many religious people the message of jesus is to help others before yourself to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit the sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time  but what would a generous act look like in our times that was the focus of the sermon the potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation who were so moved they had to take action after the sermon ended the congregation decided to take an offering a bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this christmas eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears what did they do with this offering members of the congregation drove down to the local waffle house to visit the ladies working the night shift what a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families the ladies working at waffle house clearly were not with their families they had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills the congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies and wanted to help them out they donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at waffle house in total that amounted to num being split amongst the staff what a beautiful moment what a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon doing a good deed like this on christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at waffle house sure they could not see their families but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return it was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain it speaks volumes about the merits of the church in our daily lives this simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year', 'awakening of num strands of dna

survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time this shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth if you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie alien this shark is that monster made manifest on earth this shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite it’s a deadly predator of the deep sea besides its telescoping teeth this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in num in the three decades since it was first found just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found but during a routine survey in the donghe township in taiwan the country’s fisheries research institute found five of these horrifying deepsea sharks the team was notably horrified and described the most obvious feature are the needleshaped teeth like snakelike fangs this is also the origin of viper shark name that’s right this beast is called the viper shark and as you can tell by its name it is ferocious with its prey although researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals little is known about them but researchers think these creatures swim between numnum meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to num meters below at night could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light the last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of num meters below the surface of the sea four were already dead but a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater but it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat it perished just a day later while viper sharks look like the alien monster from the movie they do not feed on humans their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes one of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish these creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glowinthedark bodies and when they swim close enough the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole the first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of shikoku island in japan in num bottomtrawler vessel seiryomaru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea because the fish was a new discovery at the time it’s scientific name honors the seiryomaru captain hiromichi kabeya the shark’s scientific name was trigonognathus kabeyai although not much about these fish are known scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark they have only been found in the deep parts of the pacific ocean how would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line would you think you were having a nightmare', 'donald trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create

shortcovering we also had a huge sized efp issuance of num contracts which exited out of the silver comex and transferred their oi to london as forwards speculators continued their interest in attacking the silver comex for physical silver  from the cme date efp’s were issued for today for a deliverable forward contract over in london with a fiat bonus we really gadate oi contracts ie num open interest contracts headed for london efp’s together with a decrease of num oi comex contracts and all of this happened with the fall in price of silver of num cents and a closing price of num

there can be a delay in the issuance of efp’s the bankers remove long positions of comex gold immediately then they orchestrate their private efp deal with the longs and that could take an additional

together with the massive increase in gold comex oi together with the total amount of gold ounces standing for january comex even though the bankers issued these monstrous efps the obligation still rests with the bankers to supply metal but it transfers the risk to a london banker obligation and not a new york comex obligation longs receive a fiat bonus together with a long london forward thus by these actions the bankers at the comex have just stated that they have no appreciable metal this is a massive fraud they cannot supply any metal to our comex longs but they are quite willing to supply massive non backed gold and silver paper knowing that they have no metal to satisfy our longs london is now severely backward in both gold and silver big rise in both gofo and sifo and we are

at a white house meeting on immigration there’s just no getting around it that some words are more painful than cuss words particularly when they heap praise on abortion advocates members of president trump’s evangelical advisory council decided to jump ship for the day and publicly sided with nancy pelosi on daca redstate date you have always taken the lead your commitment to the immigrant

partial birth abortion how sincere was rev rodriguez when he raised the name of president donald trump in prayer at his inauguration discomfited by the president’s use of an expression he has denied using rev rodriguez a member of the unofficial evangelical advisory board and the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference noted that every single person is created in the image of god and spoke of welcoming people equally from nigeria and norway albeit after a rigorous vetting process later in the day he said more in addition and with great due deference i believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong inappropriate and hurtful why because when god looks at these nations he sees his children yahoo date it should go without saying that our creator sees among his children millions of babies killed in their mother’s wombs sadly the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word as more preachworthy than the open advocation of abortion isn’t it more than a tad hypocritical if not downright sanctimonious that the vatican newspaper l’osservatore romano would try a washhismouthwithsoap stance on the latest alleged expletive of president donald trump we all know by now that president trump’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word was tattletaled to the internet world by catholic us senator dick durbin who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been repeatedly used at a white house meeting on immigration tattletale dicky durbin continued below the newspaper l’osservatore romano—the vatican’s flagship—gave trump’s comments about the immigration debate in the united states front page attention noting the comments had immediately sparked controversy and indignation never mind that trump denies using the term mercifully the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the democrats into a fullon faux rage no none of that over here but it’s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as—if not more—offensive to the faithful some some prolife catholics must have thought of the ‘s’ word when reading on twitter that abortion advocate lilianne ploumen former minister for foreign trade and development cooperation in the netherlands was recently honored by pope francis with the title of ‘commander in the pontifical equestrian order of st gregory the great’ this was one tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true the lepanto institute was able to confirm from a date dutch radio broadcast that ploumen indeed received the honor in a brief video clip promoting the broadcast ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the pope lepanto institute jan12 num to say that lilianne ploumen is proabortion is an extreme understatement and doesn’t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism in january of last year after us president donald trump reinstated the mexico city policy ploumen launched a new ngo called she decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the us government the mexico city policy automatically denies us funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion referring to the mexico

unpfa the international planned parenthood federation and marie stopes international she said these are successful and effective programs direct support distributing condoms making sure women are accompanied at the birth and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice the lepanto institute continues their ploumen profile but ploumen’s anticatholic activity isn’t restricted to abortion in september of num ploumen participated in the united nations lgbti core group as the first speaker at the event ploumen noted that lgbti rights are human rights in her opening remarks she

blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by andrew c mccarthy  family security matters new fbi texts highlight a motive to conceal the president’s involvement from the first these columns have argued that the whitewash of the hillary clintonemails caper was president barack obama’s call  not the fbi’s and not the justice department’s see eg here here and here the decision was inevitable obama using a pseudonymous email account had repeatedly communicated with secretary clinton over her private nonsecure email account these emails must have involved some classified information given the nature of consultations between presidents and secretaries of state the broad outlines of obama’s own executive order defining classified intelligence see eo num section num and the fact that the obama administration adamantly refused to disclose the clintonobama emails if classified information was mishandled it was necessarily mishandled on both ends of these email exchanges if clinton had been charged obama’s culpable involvement would have been patent in any prosecution of clinton the clintonobama emails would have been in the spotlight for the prosecution they would be more proof of willful or if you prefer grossly negligent mishandling of intelligence more significantly for clinton’s defense they would show that obama was complicit in clinton’s conduct yet faced no criminal charges that is why such an indictment of hillary clinton was never going to happen the latest jawdropping disclosures of text messages between fbi agent peter strzok and his paramour fbi lawyer lisa page illustrate this point for the moment i want to put aside the latest controversy  the fbi’s failure to retain five months of text messages between strzok and page those chattiest of starcrossed lovers yes this glitch closes our window on a critical time in the trumprussia investigation mid decedate through mid date that is when the bureau and justice department were reportedly conducting and renewing in numday intervals courtapproved fisa surveillance that may well have focused on the newly swornin president of the united states remember the bureau’s thendirector james comey testified at a march num house intelligence committee hearing that the investigation was probing possible coordination with trump’s campaign and kremlin interference in the election the retention default has been chalked up to a technological mishap assuming that this truly was an indiscriminate bureauwide problem  that lost texts are not limited to phones involved in the trumprussia investigation  it is hard to imagine its going undetected for five months in an agency whose business is information retention but it is not inconceivable attorney general jeff sessions maintains that an aggressive inquiry is underway so let’s assume for argument’s sake at least that either the texts will be recovered or a satisfactory explanation for their nonretention will be forthcoming for now let’s stick with the clintonobama emails only date comey held the press conference at which he delivered a statement describing mrs clinton’s criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment we now know that comey’s remarks had been in the works for two months and were revised several times by the director and his advisers this past weekend in a letter to the fbi regarding the missing texts senate homeland security committee chairman ron johnson r wis addressed some of these revisions according to senator johnson a draft dated date ie five days before comey delivered the final version contained a passage expressly referring to a troublesome email exchange between clinton and obama i note that the fbi’s report of its eventual interview of clinton contains a cryptic reference to a date email that clinton sent from russia to obama’s email address see report page num the passage in the june num draft stated we also assess that secretary clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent she also used her personal email extensively while outside the united states including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries that use included an email exchange with the president while secretary clinton was on the territory of such an adversary emphasis added given that combination of factors we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton’s personal email account on the same day according to a strzokpage text a revised draft of comey’s remarks was circulated by his chief of staff jim rybicki it replaced the president with another senior government official this effort to obscure obama’s involvement had an obvious flaw it would practically have begged congressional investigators and enterprising journalists to press for the identification of the senior government official with whom clinton had exchanged emails that was not going to work consequently by the time comey delivered his remarks on july num the decision had been made to avoid even a veiled allusion to obama instead all the stress was placed on clinton who was not going to be charged anyway for irresponsibly sending and receiving sensitive emails that were likely to have been penetrated by hostile intelligence services comey made no reference to clinton’s correspondent we also assess that secretary clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent she also used her personal email extensively while outside the united states including sending and receiving workrelated emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries emphasis added given that combination of factors we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton’s personal email account the decision to purge any reference to obama is consistent with the panic that seized his administration from the moment clinton’s use of a private nonsecure server system was revealed in early mdate i detailed this reaction in a series of num columns see eg here and here what most alarmed obama and clinton advisers those groups overlap was not only that there were several clintonobama email exchanges but also that obama dissembled about his knowledge of clinton’s private email use in a nationally televised interview on march num just after the new york times broke the news about clinton’s email practices at the state department john podesta a top obama adviser and clinton’s campaign chairman emailed cheryl mills clinton’s confidant and top aide in the obama state department to suggest that clinton’s emails to and from potus should be held  ie not disclosed  because that’s the heart of his exec privilege at the time the house committee investigating the benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of clinton’s emails as his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in clinton’s misconduct obama deceptively told cbs news in a march num interview that he had found out about clinton’s use of personal email to conduct state department business the same time everybody else learned it through news reports perhaps he was confident that because he had used an alias in communicating with clinton his emails to and from her  estimated to number around num  would remain undiscovered his and clinton’s advisers were not so confident right after the interview aired clinton campaign secretary josh scherwin emailed jennifer palmieri and other senior campaign staffers stating jen you probably have more on this but it looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it on the news scherwin’s alert was forwarded to mills shortly afterwards an agitated mills emailed podesta we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov that is obama had emails from clinton which he had to know were from a private account since her address did not end in stategov as state department emails do so how did obama and his helpers clean this up obama had his email communications with clinton sealed he did this by invoking a dubious presidentialrecords privilege the white house insisted that the matter had nothing to do with the contents of the emails of course rather it was intended to vindicate the principle of confidentiality in presidential communications with close advisers with the media content to play along this had a twofold benefit obama was able num to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and num to avoid using the term executive privilege  with all its dark watergate connotations  even though that was precisely what he was invoking note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions but of course that’s not a problem if there will be no prosecution the white house purported to repair the president’s disingenuous statement in the cbs interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of clinton’s homebrew server system through news reports  he hadn’t meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email this was sheer misdirection from obama’s standpoint the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account the fact that in addition clinton’s private email account was connected to her own private server system rather than some other private email service was beside the point but again the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the white house’s nonexplanation meanwhile attorney general loretta lynch ordered comey to use the word matter rather than investigation to describe the fbi’s probe of clinton’s email practices this ensured that the democratic administration’s lawenforcement agencies were aligning their story with the democratic candidate’s campaign rhetoric if there was no investigation there would be no prosecution in adate in another nationally televised interview obama made clear that he did not want clinton to be indicted his rationale was a legally frivolous straw man clinton had not intended to harm national security this was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed nor was it in dispute no matter obama’s analysis was the stated view of the chief executive if as was sure to happen his subordinates in the executive lawenforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view there would be no prosecution within a few weeks even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses  including clinton herself  had not yet been interviewed the fbi began drafting comey’s remarks that would close the investigation there would be no prosecution on june num lynch met with clinton’s husband former president bill clinton on an outoftheway arizona tarmac where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked over the next few days the fbi took pains to strike any reference to obama’s emails with mrs clinton from the statement in which comey would effectively end the matter with no prosecution on july num amid intense public criticism of her meeting with bill clinton attorney general lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the fbi director and career prosecutors made about charging clinton as page told strzok in a text that day this is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu it was also playacting page elaborated that the attorney general already knows no charges will be brought of course she did it was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution knowing that lynch had given the fbi notice on june num that she’d be announcing her intention to accept comey’s recommendation fearing this just might look a bit choreographed the fbi promptly amended comey’s planned remarks to include this assertion which he in fact made on july num i have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice or any other part of the government they do not know what i am about to say but they did not need to participate in drafting the statement and they did not need to know the precise words he was going to use it was not comey’s decision anyway all they needed to know was that there would be no prosecution on july num with the decision that she would not be indicted long since made mrs clinton sat for an interview with the fbi  something she’d never have done if there were a chance she might be charged the farce was complete with the justice department and fbi permitting two subjects of the investigation  mills and clinton aide heather samuelson  to sit in on the interview as lawyers representing clinton that is not something law enforcement abides when it is serious about making a case here however it was clear there would be no prosecution all cleaned up no indictment meaning no prosecution meaning no disclosure of clintonobama emails it all worked like a charm    except the part where mrs clinton wins the presidency and the problem is never spoken of again a version of this piece also appeared on national review online url read more great articles here url', 'i wish i had

scurrilous charges against him this was something new and it delighted his fans and the public at large even as it infuriated the increasingly volatile resistance \"before long trump was a serial

heart of journalism pope says headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next vatican city date  numnum am cnaewtn news in his message for the world day of social communications published wednesday pope francis said that in a world of lightningfast communication there is a responsibility to combat falsehood and misinformation with truth treating journalism as a peopleoriented mission in today’s world the work of journalists is in every sense not just a job it is a mission the pope wrote in his message released jan num amid feeding frenzies and the mad rush for a scoop they must remember that the heart of information is not the speed with which it is reported or its audience impact but persons informing others means forming others it means being in touch with people’s lives he continued that is why ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness generating trust and opening the way to communion and peace francis’ message for the next world day of social communications was released jan num the feast day of st francis de sales the patron saint of journalists the 52nd annual celebration will take place date on the theme ‘the truth will set you free’ jn numnum fake news and journalism for peace in today’s fastchanging world of communications and digital systems we are witnessing the spread of what has come to be known as ‘fake news’ the pope said in this way i would like to contribute to our shared commitment to stemming the spread of fake news and to rediscovering the dignity of journalism and the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth the best antidote to the spread of falsehoods in ‘fake news’ aren’t strategies he stated but people people who are not greedy but ready to listen people who make the effort to engage in sincere dialogue so that the truth can emerge people who are attracted by goodness and take responsibility for how they use language everyone has the duty to counter the lies found in ‘fake news’ he said but an even weightier responsibility falls upon those whose job it is to provide the world with information namely journalists the protectors of news francis went on to encourage everyone to promote a journalism of peace which he said doesn’t mean some saccharine or sentimental reporting that refuses to acknowledge the existence of real and serious problems rather he emphasized a journalism of peace is journalism that is truthful and opposed to falsehoods rhetorical slogans and sensational headlines a journalism created by people for people one that is at the service of all especially those  and they are the majority in our world  who have no voice a journalism he continued that is less focused on breaking news and more on exploring the underlying causes of conflicts so that it can promote a deeper understanding and contribute to resolutions by setting in place virtuous processes and offering alternatives to shouting matches the first ‘fake news’ francis said was that created by the crafty serpent in the book of genesis who used falsehood to tempt eve into disobeying god the strategy of this skilled ‘father of lies’ jn numnum is precisely mimicry that sly and dangerous form of seduction that worms its way into the heart with false and alluring arguments he said eve’s temptation by the serpent brings to light an essential element for our reflection there is no such thing as harmless disinformation he pointed out how constant exposure to deceptive language can also have harmful consequences on our interior life as illustrated by a quote from fyodor dostoevsky’s the brothers karamazov people who lie to themselves and listen to their own lie come to such a pass that they cannot distinguish the truth within them or around them and so lose all respect for themselves and for others and having no respect they cease to love and in order to occupy and distract themselves without love they give way to passions and to coarse pleasures and sink to bestiality in their vices all from continual lying to others and to themselves so how do we defend ourselves from this evil francis asked the most radical antidote to the virus of falsehood is purification by the truth which in christianity is more than just a judgment of things as true or false he said it’s also more than just revealing things that are concealed he continued truth involves our whole life truth is something you can lean on so as not to fall he said in this relational sense the only truly reliable and trustworthy one  the one on whom we can count  is the living god hence jesus can say ‘i am the truth’ to this end drawing inspiration from a franciscan prayer we might turn to the truth in person he concluded offering the following prayer lord make us instruments of your peace help us to recognize the evil latent in a communication that does not build communion help us to remove the venom from our judgements help us to speak about others as our brothers and sisters you are faithful and trustworthy may our words be seeds of goodness for the world where there is shouting let us practice listening where there is confusion let us inspire harmony where there is ambiguity let us bring clarity where there is exclusion let us offer solidarity where there is sensationalism let us use sobriety where there is superficiality let us raise real questions where there is prejudice let us awaken trust where there is hostility let us bring respect where there is falsehood let us bring

light years away in the southern constellation of vela using the eso’s very large telescope vlt at the paranal observatory in chile a team of astronomers recently studied this cluster and noticed something very interesting according to the study they released this cluster appears to have a black hole embedded in it the study appeared in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society under the title a detached stellarmass black hole candidate in the globular cluster date the study was led by benjamin giesers of the georgaugustuniversity of göttingen and included members from liverpool john moores university queen mary university of london the leiden observatory the institute of astrophysics and space sciences eth zurich and the leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam aip for the sake of their study the team relied on the multi unit spectroscopic explorer muse instrument on the vlt to observe date this instrument is unique because of the way it allows astronomers to measure the motions of thousands of far away stars simultaneously in the course of their observations the team found that one of the cluster’s stars was being flung around at speeds of several hundred kilometers an hour and with a period of num days as giesers explained in an eso press release it was orbiting something that was completely invisible which had a mass more than four times the sun — this could only be a black hole the first one found in a globular cluster by directly observing its gravitational pull this finding was rather unexpected and constitutes the first time that astronomers have been able to detect an inactive black hole at the heart of a globular cluster  meaning that it is not currently accreting matter or surrounded by a glowing disc of gas they were also able to estimate the black hole’s mass by measuring the movements of the star around it and thus extrapolating its enormous gravitational pull from its observed properties the team determined that the rapidlymoving star is about num times the mass of our sun and the mass of its black hole counterpart to be around num times the sun’s mass this put’s it in the stellarmass black hole category which are stars that exceeds the maximum mass allowance of a neutron star but are smaller than supermassive black holes smbhs  which exist at the centers of most galaxies this finding is highly significant and not just because it was the first time that astronomers have observed a stellarmass black hole in a globular cluster in addition it confirms what scientists have been suspecting for a few years now thanks to recent radio and xray studies of globular clusters and the detection of gravity wave signals basically it indicates that black holes are more common in globular clusters than previously thought until recently it was assumed that almost all black holes would disappear from globular clusters after a short time and that systems like this should not even exist said giesers but clearly this is not the case  our discovery is the first direct detection of the gravitational effects of a stellarmass black hole in a globular cluster this finding helps in understanding the formation of globular clusters and the evolution of black holes and binary systems  vital in the context of understanding gravitational wave sources this find was also significant given that the relationship between black holes and globular clusters remains a mysterious but highly important one due to their high masses compact volumes and great ages astronomers believe that clusters have produced a large number of stellarmass black holes over the course of the universe’s history this discovery could therefore tell us much about the formation of globular clusters black holes and the origins of gravitational wave events and be sure to enjoy this eso podcast explaining the recent discovery further reading eso mnras the post a black hole is pushing the stars around in this globular cluster

factor active shooter incidents headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by stephen bryen  american thinker terrorists whether domestic or foreign organizationbased or truly lone wolf and unconnected all have important advantages favoring the success of their attacks they can exploit the multiple vulnerabilities that exist in civil society notwithstanding whether the terrorists operate in democratic or authoritarian states and time is on their side terrorists exploit shock and time there is not much that can be done to remove shock from the equation a terrorist with a gun a bomb a knife or a truck can wreak a lot of havoc shock can paralyze potential victims and make it hard for law enforcement to go after the perpetrator in israel practically every adult has military training and many israelis are armed while successful attacks have occurred bombings shootings vehicle attacks and knifings to name some the advantage israel generally has is rapid reaction based on the simple fact that armed citizens know what to do when a terrorist attacks most of the rest of the world is different a police presence can help but even then in certain scenarios terrorists can be effective security guards can also help but very often they are the first target of an intruder in a building or facility in date a white supremacist numyearold james wenneker von brunn entered the holocaust museum in washington dc with a rifle and killed museum special police officer stephen tyrone johns other guards shot at von brunn who was wounded and apprehended a very important component in terrorist incidents is how long it takes for law enforcement to react and to neutralize the attacker in las vegas from the time num was sounded to the swat team destroyed the hotel room door where the shooter was took num minutes this gave the shooter ample time to use his ten guns even reloading some of them while killing num people and wounding some num others las vegas has welltrained swat teams why then did it take num minutes the same question can be asked in countless other examples whether the bataclan night club in paris date nordost siege in the dubrovka theater in moscow the virginia tech massacre in num the washington navy yard attack in the navsea building in septedate date san bernardino shooting or the pulse nightclub shooting in jdate in almost every case the problem amounted to a time problem the time problem consists of the following issues a trying to locate a shooter and b attempting to reach the shooter and neutralize him or her even with current security systems it is not easy to locate a shooter the reasons for this are the lack of proper coverage by cameras and sensors leading to many blind spots the inability to interpret surveillance images when they are available the fact that a shooter may be moving around although it would seem in the las vegas case from what we know now that the shooter operated from a hotel room and smashed out windows so he could fire on the country music festival most security systems in the united states and elsewhere in the world were designed num or more years ago while some improvements have been made wifi digital cameras replacing old analog cameras overall the nature of these systems has not changed much what they offer are pictures from different cameras that are flashed across a computer screen or a tv monitor someone in a command center is supposed to watch these pictures and sound an alarm if something happens and if they see it this type of security system primarily is valuable for collecting forensic information after an incident or suspect intrusion there the video feed can be examined even in london one of the most wiredup cities in the world it takes police anywhere from hours to days to make use of surveillance camera video footage as an aid to apprehending a terrorist obviously that is helpful but it would be

including full visualization of a facility or campus the system is now being installed at locations in the united states other technologies also could be very useful but promoting them has been a hard sell in the united states one of them is gunshot detectors gunshot detectors can actually locate a shooter in a millisecond can aim cameras in the shooter’s location and can even be slaved to sniper rifles in the hands of law enforcement while gunshot detectors in the past are fixed in place today mobile gunshot detectors can be mounted on police vehicles there are a few companies that offer such products including shotspotter in newark california and safety dynamics in tucson arizona had a mobile gunshot detector been in las vegas the shooter would have been accurately located immediately it would help a great deal if the department of homeland security dhs was more proactive in sponsoring and testing new technology aimed at reducing the time it takes to neutralize an active shooter or an intruder while dhs through the tsa has spent heavily on airport passenger and baggage security systems much of the rest has been underfunded or neglected now is the time for dhs supported by the

control of the military in a civilian government with a civilian commanderinchief they did not want a military government ruled by force rather they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law the us constitution unfortunately we in america now find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies that look and act like the military and

searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next in a few weeks domain name investors from around the world will converge in las vegas for namescon the largest event in the domain industry one of the highlights of the conference is the live domain auction hosted by rotd and prebidding has already started on namejet and like the title says there are already sixfigure bids if you’ve never been to a live domain auction i can tell you  it’s a rush that’s hard to explain at least for a domain geek like me monte cahn one of the most respected domain industry veterans will be running the auction again this year and from what i’ve seen over the years when monte’s involved a lot of the truly premium domains come out so i’m not incredibly surprised that we’re already starting to see sixfigure bids come out in prebidding more than two weeks before the auction the two domains with sixfigure bids are other notable domains with strong interest in the prebidding phase are pencom profilecom shockcom pricecom stopcom corkcom and the list goes on i think it’s safe to say that some of the best oneword coms out there are going to hit the open market during the live auction at namescon this year given that last year even twoword coms like myworldcom broke the 1m mark i think it’s safe to say this is likely going to be one of the most exciting live auctions yet as usual i’ve submitted a handful of names to the auction and i’ll be interested to see which ones make the cut one strange thing i’ve learned about myself is that for some reason when i’m in a live auction i end up with a rum and coke in my hand honestly i pretty much never drink rum and coke it’s one of my least favorite drinks but years ago i started drinking them during live auctions and now it’s become a bit of a tradition if any of my readers are going to be at namescon feel free to join me for one maybe you can start a new tradition yourself you can see the full list of domains in prebidding for the namescon

now to welcome in greg weldon ceo and president of weldon financial greg has over three decades of market research and trading experience specializing in metals and commodity markets and even authored a book in num titled gold trading bootcamp where he accurately predicted the implosion of the us credit market and urged people to buy gold when it was only num an ounce he is a highly soughtafter presenter at financial conferences throughout the country and is a regular guest on financial shows throughout the world and it’s good to have him back here on the money metals podcast greg thanks for joining us today and it’s nice to talk to you again how are you greg weldon i’m great thanks my pleasure micheal mike gleason well when we had you on back in midaugust you were optimistic about gold at the time we had a pretty good move higher shortly thereafter that ended up with gold hitting a one year high but it stalled out around num in early september and we’re currently back below num as we’re talking here on wednesday afternoon gold hit resistance at about the same level in the summer of last year so give us your update as to your current outlook what drivers if any do you see that can push gold through that num resistance level in the months ahead greg greg weldon yeah well exactly as you said you had the move that we were anticipating when we last spoke and it kind of had already started from dateish level all of this fitting into the kind of bigger picture technical structure that still leads to a bullish resolution but as you accurately mentioned you got up to what have been close to not quite even towards last summer’s highs around num num in this case around num and ran out of steam the dollar kind of changed some of the picture and the thought process linked to the fed changed some of the picture so you embarked on a downside correction num was the low you have a nice little correction from that level that was the level that equated to numday exponential moving average it’s a level that was just below the num fibonnaci retracement of the move up from num actually the move up from num back at the end of num so you had real critical support there so to me everything’s kind of mapped out the way you might expect it to structurally in this market from here one of two things happens i think well one of three things anyway you could be cut if you have a bit of low rally backed up to num you back below it a little bit to dollars still looks kind of strong it’s an interest rate differential dynamic as a more hawkish view for the fed is priced into the fed funds that gets transferred into the twoyear and fiveyear treasury notes the twoyear treasury notes at a record highyield relative to the german twoyear schatzi so that lifting the dollar … it’s kind of gravitational pull to the upside and that is some of the downside risk here that the rally we just saw is kind of you bwave and maybe you have a cwave down towards num that’s kind of an ultimate low whether or not it plays out that way longer term we still like it mike gleason precious metals have had a pretty respectable year all in all gold is up about num year to date silver is up about half as much there isn’t exactly a lot of excitement it seems like it’s always two steps forward one step back sentiment in the physical bullion markets where we operate is muted there are multiple factors to consider as to why metals markets are stuck in a bit of a rut it seems to us that one of the big ones is the equities market stock prices just keep marching relentlessly higher either investors have become totally desensitized to risk or maybe there just isn’t as much risk as well think there is in any event barring some sort of spike in inflation expectations which pushes metals and stocks both higher we don’t see gold and silver breaking out unless investors start getting nervous about stock market valuations and thinking about safe havens so what are your thoughts about equity markets and how they relate to precious metals greg and where do you see stock prices headed in the near term greg weldon yeah i mean it’s a perfect question because the reality is and we in our daily research we focused on this in fact yesterday we haven’t spoken … it sounds like we arranged this question focusing on the fact that gold relative to sp is at a low you really are kind of lows that we’ve seen before but at a level where if you get much lower you’re breaking down to multiyear lows and this whole thing gets called into question from a technical perspective but my problem with looking at it from a technical perspective is that i think the stock market is living in borrowed times basically the fed has done exactly what they wanted to do they have flushed people out of safe havens and into risk assets that’s the whole idea of qe it worked you reflated the stock market that has facilitated a huge unprecedented rise in consumer credit instead of the housing market being the collateral like it was in num date now it’s the stock market that’s the collateral the googles and amazons of the world and the facebooks of the world and you have this demand that is being driven or really being fed by credit now you see the credit numbers start to slow they’re unsustainable you start to see the consumer roll over a little bit so that’s the number one risk to the stock market it’s actually the consumer if you look at the retail sales numbers outside of automobiles and gasoline which is pricebased you don’t have much of anything and you have eating and drinking growth slowing that’s a key component a key layer to the discretionary spending that’s an important tell to the bigger picture the consumer discretionary sector is breaking down against the sp so that’s a warning sign to me you have in terms of the dynamics around what the expectation is for gdp growth predicated upon policies that have not yet been even agreed upon let alone voted upon let alone implemented let alone starting to work so i worry about that kind of fracture between the expectations the patience level of stock investors diminished returns diminished volumes i think there’s a stock market risk that’s one of the reasons we like gold because what would go hand in hand with that was some kind of maybe statement or a pull back on the dot plot from the fed that would then cause the dollar to come off its little rally here mike gleason let’s play the devil’s advocate maybe a little here we look at these record stock prices and wonder about what is beyond this extraordinarily high valuations in the past when pe ratios hit these levels it was a signal that markets were nearing a top but there’s one big difference between the past and today the advent of high frequency and machinedriven trading huge amounts of daily volume is generated by trading algorithms that is a game changer these programs don’t sense risk on an emotional level like human traders do they respond very differently to geopolitical events so if today’s markets seem disconnected from reality perhaps because it’s because they are now you have been on the front lines trading in these markets for decades you were a witness for how markets have transformed in recent years what is your take on high frequency and algorithmic trading and what does it say about the possibility that current equity market valuations can be sustained or maybe even pushed higher what are your thoughts there greg greg weldon that’s phenomenal question and it’s very well timed given that we did a big special in september called shrinkage which is a shift in the fed policy here but if you take now your question which is pertinent now and you look at experience in my experience over decades it brings date right off the bat we’re not saying the market’s going to crash there clearly there are a lot of differences but when you ask about high frequency trading it sounds to me the first thing i think of is portfolio insurance on steroids times a thousand times ten thousand so the risk in terms of just what is the catalyst that then causes kind of that cascading downside one of the things we’ve been pointing out to our customers… and by the way i’m working out a gigantic special that shows just how intriguing some of the similarities are around movements in the dollar movements in bonds movements in gold and movements in stocks and some of the ratios and even down to crude oil fed policy and cpi now as there was basically date to ’num once they kicked in the plaza accord which depreciated the dollar a lot of intriguing connections there and the special report that i’m writing on this it’s called what me worry which we’d love to make available to any of your listeners first of all if they want to email me but in terms of the catalyst setting it up again i think the landmines are laying in wait out there i think if you take an example one of the things like i said we’ve been telling our customers if you take amazon or google stock are trading at num a share you need num to buy one share so the volume of trading has diminished dramatically over the last couple of years as the stock prices has gone up the ownership is huge and it’s passive and it’s managed investments it doesn’t matter it doesn’t discriminate in terms of what type of investor the people who want to own these stocks own them the dynamic between the price level being so high nominally speaking to buy up block shares the amount of money needed pure and simple against the volume to me sets up something like you’re talking about that would be exacerbated by a flash crash so it becomes very scary in terms of what kind of meltdown could you see if you get the ball rolling to the downside i still think that this is something that will play out over some time i think the fed is there i don’t think this is … there are a lot of differences i’m not trying to make a direct ’num comparison but i’ll tell you what the risk is there no doubt about it the risk is rising mike gleason in terms of the fed here greg what is your thinking on who it might be that talks over for janet yellen as the next fed chair and then also tell us what you think they’re going to do here in terms of getting inflation to where they want basically what are your general thoughts on the fed and fed monetary policy clearly everyone’s favorite subject greg weldon really it’s two totally separate questions right now because who is donald trump going to pick versus how inflation going to play out i think if you look at what the fed is saying the fed has been very clear this is where jerome powell becomes what seems to be and i’m not saying i believe this i’m just saying it seems that powell’s a logical choice if if your goal is to maintain policy thinking about bringing in a guy like john taylor and the taylor rule and where the natural level of fed funds should be here he would obviously be a much more hawkish choice while him and trump might have really gotten along and maybe there’s a lot trump can learn from him i don’t think that’s the guy trump wants in terms of policy for trying to get his growth agenda going in that context how you maintain continuity which really isn’t that bad they’re certainly not tight and they’re not tightening to any nth degree it’s almost goldilocks material here inflation aside powell is a logical choice because you make a headline splash which of course he loves you basically make a change but you kind of keep the status quo the other one would be kevin warsh he was more away from qe and towards just using interest rates he’s an interesting kind of dark horse yellen is certainly a dark horse what mattes really is how does the fed decide they’re going to deal with this inflation issue when they can’t even decide what’s causing it because you keep hearing transitory idiosyncratic these are the words that being used repeatedly over and over and over again to describe and you’ve had one fed official go so far as and even yellen herself has made comments to the effect of we don’t understand why it’s not materializing again kind of back to the taylor model the basic rule of thumb that the fed is counting on ie hoping for is that as the labor market continues to tighten wages inflation will go up and that will support of a general rise in prices the question now becomes is the natural rate of unemployment lower than we thought it was or are there structural differences now technologically based dynamics in the labor market that has hollowed out the labor market the reason you still have participation rate while finally up a little is still so low historically therein lies the question what is it kind of keeping inflation back and how does this play out i think the employment numbers from this month for september were huge in the sense it was the biggest wage number … and you know how i break the number down to the nth degree this was the real deal only one month but still the real deal and the best wage number we’ve seen sdate so will that continue we know anecdotal evidence is there will this continue over the next couple of months if you look at cpi and ppi the pipeline the yearoveryear dynamics around some of the commodities god forbid grains oil seeds and tropical commodities started to rally because then you’d have a real problem look at what the base models are doing look at what energy potentially you’re going to break out here so i think there is some inflation coming and it’s apt to push the fed to have to raise to meet their dot plots and i think that’s going to be problematic for the equity markets they’re walking the high wire act with no safety net it’s a very difficult job mike gleason getting back to metals here for a bit we would like to give our listeners an update on the silver and gold price rigging scandal that erupted a year and a half ago when deutsche bank was forced to acknowledge cheating and turned over mountains of evidence which may prove damning for a number of other banks but the courts and regulators have a record of moving slowly if they do anything at all now you’re much closer to the futures markets than we are are you aware of any developments on that front and what do you see as the implications of the civil action against the bullion banks do you sense that the deutsche bank revelations here led to more honest markets perhaps because of all that evidence struck fear into banker’s hearts or is it more business as usual for these bullion banks who seem to have so much influence in these markets greg greg weldon i have the sense it’s business as usual i get the sense that it’s a kind of laissez faire attitude about that because the problem is so big if we were to actually kind of get unearthed the impact would be much much larger and we would know it based on the price section very quickly it’s a powder keg it’ll blow at some point this is something gosh i’ve been in the business how long and we’ve been talking about this how long really this goes way way back the degree to which it has gotten worse is i mean the thing you debate not whether it exists or not is it going to be somehow uncovered to the extent that it causes that kind of disruption i think again this is probably fodder for a great movie… a spy movie or whatever sure there’s probably a lot of that kind of thing going on in background but in terms of the day to day operation of the trading of these metals i don’t see any tangible impact in the dealings i have here no mike gleason well greg as we begin to close give us a sense of what you’re focusing on here maybe some of the things that we haven’t touched on and then give us a sense of how you’re evaluating these markets for your clients do you think it’s time to get defensive go to cash favor metals and commodities here as an inflation hedge or does the wave of exuberance in stocks still have a ways to go any final comments or anything else that you want to leave us with today greg weldon well i think some of that depends on whether they can actually get some kind of job done in washington where the republicans finally realize their own necks are on the chopping block here so let’s finally ban together and get a tax reform package done we’ll see whether that happens i think that might be one of those last gas type of moves for the stock market it could be a buy the rumor sell the fact but i think lot has been priced in and i think there’s still going to be disappointment down the road for that i’m watching the consumer specifically the retail sales numbers have been really poor all year it’s minuscule gains in discretionary items since january and the debt numbers are interesting you’re starting to see a roll over starting to see rise in delinquency rates the debt obligations for consumers and for the federal government by the way are high despite the fact that rates are still low can you imagine if the feds actually did push rates a hundred basis points higher over the next however many num num months i think that would have a real reverberating effect on the consumer and on the government where deficits are still increasing and they’re at high levels again no one talks about it you have num trillion dollars in sovereign debt and you’re about to push the fiveyear note above num which is your trigger to increase cost on funding the debt man the land mines are out there i’m watching all of it that’s what we do for our clients every single day because never before have you had to be more plugged in look at the way things happen so much more quickly now you asked about what’s the difference from num years so much more availability of news quickly but the fact of the matter is the basic thing that we do hasn’t changed at all which is dissecting all of it connecting all the dots and kind of trying to make it all make sense in terms of what the markets are doing and how you might profit from that mike gleason well greg thank you so much for joining us again we enjoyed it very much and love getting your very

those who believe in morality based selfgovernance versus those who seek mans dominion over men through manmade maninterpreted and manenforced laws they even vary among believers some of whom believe in an unwritten separation of church and state versus others who believe only in that which was actually written into our constitution by the founders if you are looking for a debate few topics will so readily attract opposition is it a question of faith or historical fact it’s hard to get folks to even agree on that then you will have to somehow separate fact from fiction as the reporting of these facts is often more hysterical than historical those who wish america a godless society have developed a plethora of arguments to support their agenda but arguments are not facts… we watch as lawyers make arguments every day seldom concerned with any facts or even any sense of real justice but they can make an argument sometimes a very successful argument if their argument is not true has justice been served is the argument right if it was made on a premise that was all wrong even though the argument is effective america is and has always been one nation under god though the founders used generic terms like creator to describe that god the god they meant was their god of the christian faith atheists and agnostics have long argued that many of the founders were deists using washington jefferson franklin paine hamilton and madison as proof however in each of these cases a study of their personal writings will debunk the myth how did america become one nation under god in dictionaries the terms deist agnostic and atheist appear as synonyms on this basis the term deists would include those who believe there is no god those who believe in a distant impersonal creator of the universe and those who believe there is no way to know if god exists a brief study of the founders own writings prove beyond any reasonable doubt that none of the notable founders fit this description thomas paine talked about the error of schools to teach sciences without reference to the being who is author of them for all the principles of science are of divine origin he stated that the evil that has resulted from the error of the schools in teaching science without god has been that of generating in the pupils a species of atheism benjamin franklin’s num plan of education for public schools in pennsylvania insisted that schools teach the necessity of a public religion    and the excellency of the christian religion above all others ancient or modern franklin proposed a biblical inscription for the seal of the united states he chose a new testament verse for the motto of the philadelphia hospital he was one of the chief proponents of a paid chaplain in congress and when franklin helped found the college which bore his name in num it was dedicated as a nursery of religion and learning built on christ the cornerstone on date george washington charged his soldiers at valley forge that to the distinguished character of patriot it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of christian in a speech on date he claimed that what children needed to learn above all was the religion of jesus christ and that to learn this would make them greater and happier than they already are on date he reminded the nation that without a humble imitation of the divine author of our blessed religion we can never hope to be a happy nation as he resigned his post as commanderinchief washington’s own adopted daughter declared of washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his christianity hamilton began work with the rev james bayard to form the christian constitutional society to help spread over the world the two things which hamilton said made america great num christianity and num a constitution formed under christianity only hamilton’s death two months later thwarted his plan of starting a missionary society to promote christian government thomas jefferson himself declared i am a real christian that is to say a disciple of the doctrines of jesus as president of the united states jefferson signed a treaty with the kaskaskia tribe wherein he provided—at the government’s expense—christian missionaries james madison trained for ministry with the rev dr john witherspoon and madison’s writings are replete with declarations of his faith in god and in christ in his letter to attorney general bradford madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their christian faith in public and that public officials should be fervent advocates in the cause of christ madison did allude to a wall of separation but contemporary writers frequently omit madison’s own definition of that wall which according to madison was only to prevent congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion there you have it… do any of these men sound like deists to you it is not hard to demonstrate that america was indeed born one nation under god or that the god or creator they were referring to was in fact jesus christ this alone should lay to rest any honest debate over how america became a nation built upon judeochristian principles and values we can go on and on founder after founder if you want but these are the men named by most who argue that the founders were at best deists why was america formed as one nation under god the answer is simple yet of vital importance to every american regardless of their religious beliefs the answer begins with these two words selfgovernance patrick henry put it this way it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religions but on the gospel of jesus christ john adams said it this way we recognize no sovereign but god and no king but jesus date and he later explained we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion avarice ambition revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other—date the point is this  it is historically indisputable that america was born one nation under god it does not require faith but instead common logic to understand why men without a moral compass are incapable of longterm selfgovernance the founders knew it because they had seen it few modern americans have experienced what life would be like in a godless society void of morality so they question it many americans place their trust in man over god so they pursue it but there is no question what america was is should be or must be in order to retain its position of strength as the freest nation of selfgoverned individuals on earth we will either be free as one nation under god or we will be a nation of fools unaware of our common heritage and on the road to ruin under men in search of power one does not have to be a christian to understand this one must only understand man and his insatiable hunger for power those in search of that power must remove god from society in order to gain access to that power those who allow them do so at their own peril you are of course free to not like this simple truth but this truth will never change it is as it has always been…and shall always be  special thanks to david barton at wallbuilders for some of the reference material used herein',

heroes monuments memorials and flags to be regulated to a role of less importance than deserved in american history and to be viewed in a negative perspective by much of the american public us president woodrow wilson is quoted as saying the role of slavery became the proclaimed cause of the civil war because it was necessary to put the south at a moral disadvantage by transforming the contest from a war for independence into a war waged for the maintenance and extension of slavery if slavery was all the southern states wanted they could have kept it without a war or firing a shot the north offered the south the corwin amendment to the us constitution in mdate that would have made slavery permanently legal in america if they would rejoin the union the south refused and the constitution of the confederate states of america banned the international slave trade most educated southerners were in favor of gradual orderly emancipation which would have prevented segregation

slavery but white christian southerners who fly the confederate battle flag are not the enemy of responsible black americans who are working to better themselves the confederate flag is the last flag to represent the concept of local control of ones’ life in america in a larger sense it represents the same values and principles as the original us betsy ross flag limited constitutional federal government states rights resistance to tyranny and christian principles and values thus it represents government of the people by the people and for the people with the consent of the governed the confederate flag is an internationally recognized symbol of resistance to tyranny that is why it was flying over the berlin wall when it was being torn down in num and has been flown by numerous countries or provinces seeking independence it reminds knowledgeable americans that government is to be held accountable for its actions and if those actions are viewed as not being in the best interest of the people there is a price to be paid for it this fact has not been lost upon the socialist communist liberal left and that is why they have spent inordinate amounts of money and energy trying to suppress this powerful symbol of freedom the confederate battle flag is a christian symbol and that is why proponents of secular humanism the belief that there is no god and man science and

blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next despite the ideological and social divides currently plaguing our culture one common theme seems to hold across all the differences americans do not like congress even the relatively apolitical seem to be roused against them with many speaking out against recent bills and congressional initiatives and phrases like drain the swamp abounding on social media shouldn’t more people lead to better decisions at least when it comes to government the answer would seem to be no the assumption seems to be that if we could only get the right people in office things would improve however it would not seem that the problem is the people in the system but an inherent flaw in the system itself social psychology is not a discipline which tends to address issues of political organization however many current political issues including the recent wave of hatred for congress can be analyzed in the light of social psychological principles such as the classic theory of groupthink what is groupthink first studied by yale psychologist irving janis in dates groupthink refers to the tendency of groups to make bad or even disastrous decisions groupthink was first studied by social psychologists after the bay of pigs when the question was how could president kennedy with a cabinet of experts have made a decision so flawed he himself would later call it stupid shouldn’t more people lead to better decisions at least when it comes to government the answer would seem to be no in date book victims of groupthink a psychological study of foreign policy decisions and fiascos dr janis identifies three risks for groupthink’s occurrence which are still taught in psychology classrooms today desire for cohesiveness structural faults and the power of the situation looking at how congress operates today it is not hard to see how it is inherently at risk of groupthink and to understand the slew of badunpopular decisions which seem to have become commonplace the three risks for groupthink occurrence congressmen like justin amash or senators like bernie sanders are often touted as rabblerousers cohesion the first risk for groupthink is an overwhelming desire for cohesiveness groups run the risk of groupthink when they value unity over making the bestethical decision very often when groups value unity too highly they fall prey to the phenomenon of deindividuation the foregoing of individual beliefs and principles in favor of those of the group it no longer matters what the individual believes or wants in such circumstances it’s a matter of yielding to group influence symptoms of this desire for cohesion can include the derogation of dissenters trying to limit the questioning of group decisions and the existence of mindguards individuals who ensure that dissent is kept to a minimum it’s not hard to find examples of these phenomena in the current political atmosphere congressmen like justin amash or senators like bernie sanders are often touted as rabblerousers who don’t tow the party line the idea is often expressed that principles should take a backseat to party unity and party accomplishment which so often takes the form of voting the right way there are also tests for party purity such as the democrats’ recent prochoice test the idea that a real democrat cannot be prolife structural faults when congressmen like rand paul have filibustered in opposition to their party’s agenda leaders like john mccain attack them implying they need to fall in line the second risk for groupthink is structural faults specifically insulation and closed leadership by being insulated from outside voices or dissenting opinions all while being subjected to leadership which discourages dissent and dictates how it is a group is likely to doom itself to making a poor decision congress seems to be inherently insulated when it comes to its decisionmaking in theory congresspeople represent their constituency’s interests at the federal level however most congresspeople are not particularly in touch with their constituency such insulation is not congress’s fault but rather a fault in design washington is geographically isolated from most of the united states getting in touch with one’s congressperson can be nigh on impossible especially if one is far from washington the bestcase scenario tends to be leaving messages with congressional aides but chances for actual direct contact are low the only exception seems to be on the campaign trail the goal of which is not governance but reelection for senators such insulation can be doubly strong with the passage of the 17th amendment senators became essentially unaccountable to any form of local governance for a majority of their term of office in theory the direct election of senators gives locals a chance to vote them out but it can be hard to remember senators’ specific legislative actions when election season rolls around afterward which can take several years the second structural fault which increases the risk of groupthink is that of closed leadership leaders who say this is how it is such leaders often play the role of mindguards quashing dissent and trying to ensure that congresspeople behave according to the party line rather than their own beliefs again it’s not hard to find instances of this in recent politics when congressmen like ted cruz or rand paul have filibustered in opposition to their own party’s agenda republican leaders like john mccain came out to attack them as essentially traitors the implication being that they need to fall in line their own principles be damned the power of the situation time pressures pose a similar risk for groupthink the third and final risk for groupthink is the power of the situation very often our behavior is as much a function of our circumstances as our own individuality two situational features increase the likelihood of groupthink perceived threats and time pressure the idea of responding strongly and quickly to a threat is powerful even evolutionarily advantageous however quick and strong responses are not often if ever the best decisions both parties often frame their agendas in opposition to an enemy often the opposite party it’s a matter of defeating the other party via unanimous support with no room for individual principles or beliefs this is date+ pagelong legislation gets voted on immediately with no chance for discussion action is required else they are going to win time pressures pose a similar risk for groupthink the idea of having to get something  anything  done before they can enact their sinister agenda seems to define modern political rhetoric we have to pass healthcaretax plansnet neutrality immediately meanwhile little chance for elaboration or discussion of these bills’ merits is given and shockingly the results are rarely beneficial until this occurs the swamp is going to remain no matter who inhabits what office reducing groupthink’s influence many strategies exist for combating groupthink however two commonalities have emerged across most strategies the importance of dissent and providing time to examine alternatives in the current political climate it is highly doubtful that either of these strategies is feasible at the federal level congress as it currently functions rife with partisan strife and both socially and geographically insulated does not seem able to resist groupthink so what might be the solution even at america’s birth our founders stressed the danger of a centralized government gaining too much power and ceasing to truly represent their constituents whatever solution is found it is of the utmost importance that they are kept in touch with those they represent and that partisan politics do not encourage legislation for the sake of unity but rather for the sake of principle until this occurs the swamp is going to remain no matter who inhabits what office source url', 'all three are vying for power and money rahmbo and the school board are dealing with an unpleasant reality a reality that none of them understand but that is a reality nonetheless there simply is not enough money to keep funneling into the black hole that is the failed chicago school system nevertheless the teacher’s union and their members are clamoring for more and more money for themselves look at this past week for an example of why chicago is a perfect case study in how liberalism consumes itself you have rahm emanuel mayor and far leftist who used to be president obama’s left hand man you have the chicago school board all liberals then you have finally the teacher’s union whose leadership and membership act like perfect little soldiers of karl marx and all three are in conflict if you want to see liberalism devouring itself chicago is a great petri dish to observe there liberals are always pitted against other liberals as they vie for an ever shrinking piece of the pie those insisting on a bigger slice do not realize the fact that the pie keeps getting smaller because of liberalism in the first place point of note number one chicago’s teachers are already among the highest paid in the nation at num average salary point of note number two chicago schools are some of the worst performing in the state of illinois with num of the bottom num schools residing in the city conclusion simply dumping money into the system paying teachers a boatload of cash and keeping teachers who do not perform does not solve the problem yet there are the teachers who are failing to educate our children striking and demanding more for not educating our children they have turned down a num raise something only government workers get these days over num years they are demanding raises job security and benefit guarantees at the same time they are fighting tooth and nail against an evaluation process designed to weed out teachers not earning their already hefty salaries only in a liberal haven like chicago what is worse is that the teachers who are striking are mindless zombies jumping because they are being told to jump some of the signs the useful idiots are carrying are very illustrative of this point for example one of the signs carried by the communist red clad strikers said schools for people not for profit question for that useful idiot how much profit did she make last year did she pocket anything oh you know she did you can be certain she did not donate her time but then again she’s a liberal so don’t expect her to understand her own hypocrisy it’s ok for her to profit just not anyone else one sign i have seen a lot reads i am a teacher yes but the question is are you a good teacher and did you earn your paycheck see that’s the point of the testing program the school’s wants to institute but the bad teachers and the union leaders are so frightened that they might be found that they will not allow such things another sign by the aflcio local num reads on strike for better schools well they certainly can’t get much worse i say stay on strike then the school district can hire new teachers to replace the incompetent lazy teachers with a sense of entitlement who are currently teaching our children that way schools might actually get better not what the unionistas mean but the truth nonetheless then there is the crazy woman hanging out of a school bus window with a sign students before bankers huh that’s just nonsensical but ok let’s go with it the teacher’s union i am sure has this moron’s pension invested with a banker somewhere let’s take that money away from the banker and her and write every student a check instead let them do with it as they please if they opt to go and get an education great if they choose to sit around and smoke crack sobeit but make them sign a waiver saying they understanding that there will be no future benefits if they adopt the later approach then when this yummy brain decides she wants to retire she’ll no doubt rant and scream about where her money is we will just point back to the photographic evidence of her philosophy and remind her that her money once held by bankers went to the students instead oh and by the way considering that the strike she supports left num students out of school the sign should actually read if it were honest myself before students seriously i have never seen as big a bunch of whiners or idiots for that matter there is something seriously wrong with the mentality engrained in many of our teachers these days note i said many i did not say all or even most but there are many who feel they are entitled to be teachers if they simply want to be teachers yet the rest of us actually have to prove ourselves competent at our profession in order to keep our jobs and we don’t get guaranteed raises every year because of a contract no we have to prove ourselves worthy every year when evaluation time rolls around i feel sorry for those teachers who are actually good teachers there are many of them but the display in chicagoland gives even those good teachers a bad reputation personally i would let them keep striking and hire replacement teachers we need people teaching our children who actually want to teach we don’t need people who look at the profession as a scheme to make nearly twice as much as the average chicago resident paying their salary does', 'num scandalous reasons big finance is trying hard to keep a low profile photo credit songquan deng  shutterstockcom few news outlets are more sympathetic to the financial services industry than the wall street journal so it’s interesting when the paper reports from london that antibanking sentiment here is still off the charts leaving the industry gun shy about flaunting wealth that was also true at the olympics even though the games are typically one of the biggest corporate schmoozefests on the calendar this is part of what the journal calls a wave of banker austerity with executives skipping the usual hired black sedan and champagne and even resorting to putting up important clients in mere three or fourstar hotels overall the city of london’s highrolling banking industry is rolling as low as possible in order to avoid displays of wealth that will further inflame an already angry public so why is the public so inflamed with antibanking sentiment recent events here and in the uk make it easy to see num fool me num times shame on you for britons at the top of the list stands the libor ratefixing scandal in which the uk’s most prominent banks conspired to fix a baseline interest rate thats used to calculate rates on thousands of financial products like mortgages the scandal continues to unfold with giants citigroup and chase still awaiting charges among others but as is common in episodes where major banks have committed largescale fraud in this case involving hundreds of billions of dollars in financial instruments the most heavily implicated bank barclay’s is not facing legal prosecution merely a large fine the new york times dealbook described the settlement as a multimillion dollar financial penalty and modest admission of wrongdoing but no criminal conviction to affect its operation pretty gentle treatment for a firm whose traders while working to manipulate the key rate said in emails while executing the collusion always happy to help for you anything done…for you big boy and from a more conscientious employee i will reluctantly gradually and artificially get my libors in line especially notable in this connection is the conspicuous absence of bob diamond the disgraced exceo of barclay’s from the london games since diamond had been a fixture for years at uk events and had been planning to attend several olympic events as a guest…but after the furor surrounding his resignation he is expected to stay away the banks are politically smart enough to keep their heads down when they look bad of course the libor affair pales in its human impact when compared with other recent banking scandals like the robosigning scandal in the us in that scam thousands of homes mortgaged during the housing bubbles were foreclosed upon without the required legal standing or paperwork the implicated banks including the four us megabanks—bank of america chase citigroup and wells fargo—settled the charges with the justice department and the states for num billion an impressive figure however the settlement does little for the real human families evicted fraudulently including threequarters of a million evictees who were foreclosed upon from the finance crisis through the end of num most of whom received a check for num each num sanctionsbusters in the fastmoving world of banking scandals standard chartered of london impressively secured a spot for itself when it was accused by a new york regulator of laundering a quarter trillion dollars in iranian money in violation of us economic sanctions on the country you don’t have to support the efforts of the us government to economically strangle iran to appreciate the disregard for law in company emails cited in the criminal charge including an executive confiding that the iranian trading had the potential to cause very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage to the group standard chartered settled the charges for num million in hopes it can avoid admitting wrongdoing indeed this type of fraud is increasingly prevalent among the financial sector with banking giant hsbc accused of laundering mexican drug cartel money along with cash from saudi banks with terrorism ties ing bank recently spent millions settling a charge that it also bucked international sanctions to move cuban and iranian money these abovethelaw moves while possibly helping the peoples of these countries against the suffocation of their economies by the us no doubt add to the inflamed feelings of the general public num one nation under fraud the power of the financial sector is such that the sec whose job is to examine financial firms and prevent or punish fraud has become notorious for avoiding punishing firms for lying even when dealing with repeat offenders while financial law allows serious penalties for fraud including large fines and restrictions on business practices the sec allows waivers for these offenses and has granted them quite liberally to the largest us banks chase has settled six fraud cases sdate with settlements that run into the hundreds of millions of dollars but has argued before the sec that it has a strong record of compliance with securities laws notably the sec justifies settling these cases and issuing waivers by referring to promises from the firms not to violate the law in the future yet when the firms are taken back to court for their next act of fraud their recidivism rarely brings a stiffer penalty as any mere human would likely receive in fact of these waivers issued by the regulator nearly half go to repeat offenders wall street firms that had settled previous fraud charges by agreeing never again to violate the very laws that the sec was now saying that they had broken this includes other industry giants like bank of america and also citigroup which racked up so much fraud it finally did get sanctioned the ability of the megabanks to weasel out of sanctions for widespread fraud are a third reason industry’s keen to stay below the radar num highspeed glitches further undermining confidence in our financial cornerstones are the recurrent glitches in large computerized stock trading systems that have lead to horrifying market swings date saw the stock exchange lose literally trillions of dollars of value in just several minutes only to recover again within another num minutes august of this year began with a similar outofcontrol development on the market as retail trading company knight capital group had a technology issue with its brandnew automated stocktrading system while it was supposed to react to trading by others the computer system instead placed giant orders to the point that millions of erroneous trades were made often at inflated prices such that knight ended up having to seek new equity partners to stay afloat computer algorithmbased trading strategieslike those used by knight are another product of regulatory loosening over the last two decades to the point that half of stock trading is now handled by such highspeed firms to compensate for the increased instability such deregulation has brought about the securities and exchange commission maintains circuit breakers to cut off trading if the price of a particular stock behaves erratically unfortunately these countermeasures are not activated until num minutes after the beginning of trading whereas knight’s algorithm began runaway trading immediately the upshot of course is to make finance in general and equity trading in particular more suspiciously viewed by the public as the times put it the chaotic computer trading was the latest black eye for the financial markets…drawing renewed attention to the fragility and instability of the nation’s stock markets num fed by the fed notably the banks are increasingly dependent on government action for their profits in recent years the central bank of the eu and the us federal reserve have engaged in a somewhat desperate mode of economic stimulus quantitative easing where the fed buys bonds from major banks in order to inject more cash into the banking system with the goal of lowering interest rates and hopefully increasing economic growth this bond buying has become a significant profit center for the banking majors with bondtrading income exploding shortly after each round of mostly ineffective monetary stimulus the business press notes that big trading banks are particularly well positioned to profit when central banks act aggressively the firms help make markets in bonds and derivatives when the banks’ clients see the fed take bold steps they feel encouraged and come off the sidelines to buy more bonds this increases the amount of business that flows through wall street but it also lifts the prices of the bonds that banks hold creating profits for the traders the ability of the banking industry to sustain its profitability and power despite scandal after scandal  and after crisis after technological disaster  speaks to its unparalleled power in the modern economy but beside the social power of the firms to dominate markets and shape perceptions with ad spending and their obvious political muscle the banks also make use of their power in a more everyday fashion in maintaining relatively high retail interest rates in the us the mortgagehandling banks are benefiting in historically large terms from the growing spread between the low rates they pay to investors they sell mortgages to and the higher rates they charge the actual homeowner the times business section notes that if the market were functioning properly the recent drop in the bond rates should have led to a larger decline in mortgage rates for consumers than has actually occurred instead the difference between the two rates is increasing one suggested reason mortgage lenders may also be benefiting from less competition the upheaval of the financial crisis of num has led to the concentration of mortgage lending in the hands of a few big banks primarily wells fargo jpmorgan chase bank of america and us bancorp this long record suggests why the finance industry is

accelerated with an enormous amount of bloodshed crammed into a short time frame the american revolution crisis lasted twenty one years the great depressionworld war ii crisis lasted seventeen years all three prior american fourth turnings ended with an allout decisive war with clear victors and vanquished based on historical precedent this fourth turning shouldn’t reach its resolution until the midnum’s with a major global conflict on the near term horizon those who understand that something wicked this way comes are frustrated by the apparent slowness of the progression they shouldn’t be too anxious for an acceleration since strauss  howe didn’t formulate their generational theory udate this is the first fourth turning in which some people understand the dynamics driving the crisis does knowledge about a cycle change the underlying forces propelling history has the establishment oligarchy coopted the crisis mood of the country to avoid its own demise or is this fourth turning just proceeding according to the standard morphology along its two decade long test of survival i honestly don’t know this is my first and only fourth turning what i do know is the crisis began in the time frame predicted by strauss  howe the catalyst was date financial meltdown created by wall street and the federal reserve just as they had done in num to catalyze the previous fourth turning strauss and howe documented the four stages of a fourth turning a crisis era begins with a catalyst  a startling event or sequence of events that produces a sudden shift in mood once catalyzed a society achieves a regeneracy  a new counterentropy that reunifies and reenergizes civic life the regenerated society propels toward a climax  a crucial moment that confirms the death of the old order and birth of the new the climax culminates in a resolution  a triumphant or tragic conclusion that separates the winners from losers resolves the big public questions and establishes the new order date global financial meltdown most certainly produced a sudden shift in mood average working class americans saw their retirement savings obliterated for the second time in the space of eight years millions lost their jobs and got thrown out of their homes by the wall street bankers who perpetrated the greatest financial fraud in world history the american citizens who overwhelmingly disapproved of tarp were disregarded as captured corrupt congressmen handed num billion of taxpayer funds to the wall street criminals the darker shift in mood produced the tea party movement and the occupy wall street movement both movements were coopted by the establishment and effectively extinguished as change agents over the next seven years a massive debt produced bubble has been blown in stock bond and real estate markets to benefit only those in the upper echelon of wealth wall street is winning in a blowout over main street as num morphed into the historic year of vitriol hate fake news russians

triggered on campuses across the land retreating to safe spaces with crayons and coloring books antifa fascists rioted beat trump supporters and attempted to shutdown free speech at every opportunity

his agenda his election has revealed an ingrained establishment aka swamp creatures inhabited by politicians of both parties who are intent on sabotaging his presidency the first ten months of his

debasing schemes implemented by captured central bankers the world is hurtling relentlessly toward conflict war and bloodshed every previous american fourth turning saw an upwards ratchet in violence death and technological killing devices this fourth turning will see a continuation of this trend fourth turning wars are always decisive with clear winners and losers the revolutionary war erupted two years after the boston tea party catalyst and lasted for eight years the civil war swept the country into conflict shortly after lincoln’s election the second world war didn’t encroach on the lives of americans until num years after date great crash each crisis will have its own dynamics pace and timing based upon specific events leadership decisions and generational reactions to the incidents and episodes driving the crisis we are in year nine of this fourth turning and a looming bloody conflict is just over the horizon but the vast majority of the american populace is unprepared and unaware for such a trial by fire date volcanic eruption has continued to flow along the channels of distress impacting nations across the globe yeoman efforts by the deep state to keep the molten flow within controlled channels are failing with the eruption about to burst free and cause global havoc on a grand scale as predicted by strauss  howe imagine some national and probably global volcanic eruption initially flowing along channels of distress that were created during the unraveling era and further widened by the catalyst trying to foresee where the eruption will go once it bursts free of the channels is like trying to predict the exact fault line of an earthquake all you know in advance is something about the molten ingredients of the climax which could include the following economic distress with public debt in default entitlement trust funds in bankruptcy mounting poverty and unemployment trade wars collapsing financial markets and hyperinflation or deflation social distress with violence fueled by class race nativism or religion and abetted by armed gangs underground militias and mercenaries hired by walled communities political distress with institutional collapse open tax revolts oneparty hegemony major constitutional change secessionism authoritarianism and altered national borders military distress with war against terrorists or foreign regimes equipped with weapons of mass destruction the fourth turning  strauss  howe the american revolution military conflict was with an external enemy the civil war was an internal conflict between americans world war ii was again an external conflict will the coming conflict be domestic foreign or both every fourth turning has internal and external struggles and skirmishes loyalists battled patriots during the american revolution both sides attempted to seek european support during the civil war a resolute opposition despised fdr and even sought to organize a military coup to seize power of the government this fourth turning is progressing along a dual path of internal and external clashes destined to define the events which will propel the world towards a climax and resolution of this fourth crisis period in us history the apparent slowness of this fourth turning is not unusual and the rise in the stock market in the midst of the crisis does not alleviate the dire circumstances of the crisis from its low in num the stock market rose by over num by num in the midst of the great depression before another num plunge the current fed financed stock market rally has driven stocks up about num from date lows stock markets do not define when a crisis has ended for the majority of americans because so few people own a significant amount of stock the average american suffered economic hardship throughout dates just as average americans have continued to suffer economic hardship sdate as americans dealt with privation and poverty in the dates the coming global conflict was brewing animosities prejudices and resentments exacerbated by economic turmoil stirred militaristic ambitions of hubristic rulers in europe and asia the parallels with the current international dynamic are eerie the exact timing of the chaotic dangerous portion of this fourth turning is uncertain but it can’t be escaped don’t think you can escape the fourth turning the way you might today distance yourself from news national politics or even taxes you don’t feel like paying history warns that a crisis will reshape the basic social and economic environment that you now take for granted the fourth turning necessitates the death and rebirth of the social order it is the ultimate rite of passage for an entire people requiring a luminal state of sheer chaos whose nature and duration no one can predict in advance  strauss  howe  the fourth turning url part num in part num of this article i provided the background regarding the phases of fourth turnings and where we stand nine years into this period of crisis i will now ponder what could happen during the remainder of this fourth turning history offers no guarantees obviously things could go horribly wrong  the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues from terrorist anarchy to hightech dictatorship we should not assume that providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others not just temporary hardship but debasement and total ruin losing in the next fourth turning could mean something incomparably worse it could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence  perhaps even our nation  might never recover  strauss  howe  the fourth turning the most important point to comprehend is the death of the existing social order always occurs during the course of a fourth turning thus far those constituting the deep state hierarchy have fended off their demise they are utilizing every tool at their disposal to retain their wealth power and control as their mass media propaganda machine falters they have redoubled their rigging of financial markets to promote a narrative of economic recovery while further enriching themselves and their cronies it is clear they have reached the peak of financial manipulation money printing and artificial interest rate suppression the narrative is faltering their last and final option to retain power is war as their everything bubble stocks bonds real estate inevitably implodes civil andor global military conflict will be utilized to distract the populace from their deep state domestic disasters the time for compromise is long past there are no moderates left in the political spectrum the mood of the country is clearly trending towards conflict trump as the grey champion of this fourth turning has proven to be a lightning rod of hate he infuriates his political opponents the left wing media many in his own party foreign leaders billionaires and most worrisome to his wellbeing  the shadowy surveillance state intel operatives his own fbi and cia have been subverting his presidency and attempting to initiate his impeachment or as a last resort  coup after running a campaign championing a reduction in foreign military intervention in the middle east reducing commitments to nato and increasing cooperation with russia it appears trump has been taken into a room and told the military industrial complex calls the shots trump has clearly made a selfpreservation decision to avoid being jfk’d the possibility of global catastrophe is not taken seriously by the vast majority of americans it’s been over seventy years since the last global conflict and most of the people who experienced the horror are dead we’ve forgotten the past and are condemned to relive it just as we do every eighty or so years the lack of volatility in financial markets portends drastic levels of volatility as the perception markets can’t fall has lured wall street num something mbas and the investor class into a sense of invincibility geopolitical tensions have been rising dramatically over the last few years with religious extremism oil petrodollar historical rivalries and nationalism driving the world towards conflict these extreme economic and geopolitical stresses are coinciding along the same timeline and will erupt simultaneously catalyzing the climactic half of this fourth turning the risk of catastrophe will be very high the nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence crack up geographically or succumb to authoritarian rule if there is a war it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort  in other words a total war every fourth turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction and in mankind’s willingness to use it  strauss  howe  the fourth turning with the house of saud descending into madness as religious zealots kings princes and foreign infiltrators vie for control of their depleting oil riches and tens of billions in high tech weaponry provided by american arms dealers a middle east conflagration is a certainty iran has been winning the proxy wars in syria iraq and yemen saudi arabia and israel are determined to stop iran’s expansion at any cost mixing religious extremism oil riches gas pipelines opium egotistical dictators nuclear bombs hatred and territorial ambitions into the deepening militaristic global mood change is destined to spark a chain reaction of unintended consequences and unyielding responses the next middle east war will not be a proxy war it will be a fight to the death you need a scorecard to figure out the alliances opponents and wildcards iran appears to be aligned with iraq qatar syria hezbollah yemen and russia saudi arabia appears to be aligned with israel uae and the united states various factions who include turkey isis al qaeda and the kurds are fighting one or more of these parties in many cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend applies peace and compromise are out of the question at this point it’s just a matter of who pulls the trigger to kick off the fireworks it looks like saudi arabia is willing to gamble everything on a final showdown with iran once the shooting starts and the us and russia are sucked in all bets are off on what happens next diplomacy will not be an option this scenario presumes a korean conflict doesn’t happen first with reckless actions on the part of kim jung un and reckless rhetoric from both sides the odds of a korean conflict are the highest since dates with three carrier groups sitting off the korean coastline just one provocative act or mistake could unleash a fusillade from both sides killing hundreds of thousands in a matter of days global treaties alliances and economic realities are pushing global powers in unforeseen directions just as this fourth turning enters its most dangerous phase human failings are the constant throughout history but human failings resulted in num deaths during the american revolution crisis they could result in hundreds of millions of deaths during this crisis the us and europe’s provocative actions with nato forces surrounding russia the ongoing ukraine civil war the syrian civil war and false accusations of rigging the us presidential election have pushed russia into a closer alliance with china saudi arabia has also strengthened ties with china as the debt financed shale oil boom has lessened us purchases of opec oil the eu is falling apart as debt creation has failed to revive economies governments are bankrupt muslim hordes destroy their social fabric and a revolutionary spirit is in the air germany france sweden and most of europe have signed their own death warrant by allowing their countries to be invaded by millions of young muslim men intent on destroying their way of life global disorder is expanding exponentially and is surely leading towards war war will either be the trigger for the forthcoming financial crash or a direct result of the forthcoming financial crash the core elements of this fourth turning debt civic decay global disorder are going to juxtapose and connect accelerating into a chain reaction of chaos civil uprising global war mass casualties the fall of empires and ultimately the destruction of the existing social order aka deep state when americans see their wealth vaporized for the 3rd time in less than two decades by the same criminal bankers and corrupt politicians they will not forgive forget and bail them out again they will seek out the guilty and make them pay through street justice the fraudulent deep state controlled scheme is beyond redemption and must be destroyed in order for a constitution based free market system to be reintroduced the result could also be dictatorship or worse the outcomes will be determined by the actions we take as citizens with a debt inundated global economy already slowing panicked central bankers beginning to take their foot off the accelerator massively overvalued stock bond and real estate markets consumers in debt up to their eyeballs stagnant wages rising inflation currency and trade wars heating up deficits rising again and gridlocked legislative bodies the onset of war in the middle east would cause oil prices to skyrocket and trigger the stock market collapse num at this point even the slightest hint of wage inflation causing interest rates to rise even modestly would prompt a market meltdown the perfect storm is headed our way the triple threats of debt civic decay and global disorder cannot be avoided we can’t defy the chaos set in motion by the cyclical nature of history the seasons cannot be reversed so we must brace ourselves for the oncoming storms the future’s uncertain and the end is always near  jim morrison no one here gets out alive  jim morrison there are no guarantees or certainties regarding what happens over the remaining decade or so of this fourth turning don’t believe god will exempt our empire from the tragedies that have befallen past empires debasement and total ruin are not inconsequential possibilities hubris arrogance decadence and debt have devastated previous global empires and are present today in copious quantities as the american empire enters its critical threshold of national survival there are a myriad of internal and external competing forces which threaten both the status quo and very existence of our nation there will be moments of extreme danger and severe threats in the coming years i do not consider the russian people or the chinese people my enemies but my government will attempt to convince us to go to war against them in order to maintain their empire human nature has not changed over the course of history but the technological advancements in warfare have placed the ability to obliterate the planet into the hands of weak minded malevolent men whose egotism and thirst for power know no bounds human flaws and frailties could endanger the world and its inhabitants do you trust the leadership of your country to do what’s in your best interest i do not trust my government i do not trust the puppet politician front men for the deep state i do not trust the megacorporations who dominate our economy i do not trust central bankers and their wall street owners i do not

skills i trust my immediate family members i trust some of my neighbors i trust more of people i’ve met through my blog than i’ve met face to face i trust normal people living normal lives across this once great country i trust the people who distrust the people and things i distrust as events spiral out of control we will need to pick and choose our friends carefully if or when the government attempts to force my three sons into a war on behalf of the vested interests to retain their wealth and power i will resist with every ounce of strength in my aging body they will not become cannon fodder for the deep state we don’t know the events and path which will drive the remainder of this crisis but we do know our choices will matter this is no time for apathy and complacency for those who grasp generational theory and the cycles of history the seemingly unbearable slowness of this fourth turning is actually a blessing the slowness allows more time to prepare if you haven’t prepared

summarized his plan to make the tax code fairer by saying i think when you spread the wealth around it’s good for everybody obama may not be cut out of the same cloth as lenin but he is a socialist and socialism is his agenda marxism spawned socialism marxism produced the foundation of european welfare state socialism the european model tried to nationalize socialism as with the bolshevik revolution but with less success after the failure of nationalization through revolution european socialists realized that free enterprise in private hands produced capital money which they could then steal through taxation and then redistribute to all through social programs thereby achieving socialism where european socialism prevails there is a cost according to paul roderick gregory the european welfare state takes one half of national output to provide state health care pensions extended unemployment benefits income grants and free higher education obama feverishly promotes

fairness in healthcare fair share of tax payments fair prices for all through state controlled markets fairness for the environment through green energy racial fairness through enforced civil rights

according to a top senate democrat we are on the precipice of committing us forces to another forever war maryland sen ben cardin the ranking member on the foreign relations committee said thursday that was a rebuke of secretary of state rex tillerson who outlined trump’s policy for syria following the destruction of the islamic state as a landholding terrorist organization tillerson explained that us forces and diplomats must work to prevent the resurgence of isis and the domination of syria by iranianbacked terrorists but cardin maintained the new policy exceeds anything authorized by congress i am extremely disappointed that the trump administration announced a significant change in us policy — the commitment of us forces for an indefinite period of time in syria — without first consulting congress cardin said the trump administration lacks the authority to keep us military forces in syria after the defeat of isis trump like former president barack obama has traced the legal authority for counterisis operations back to the legislation that authorized military action action against al qaeda in response to the date terrorist attacks isis formed out of the remnants of al qaeda’s affiliate in iraq tillerson tied the new syria policy to that legal basis by noting the potential for isis to rehabilitate itself in the absence of us forces isis presently has one foot in the grave and by maintaining an american military presence in syria until the full and complete defeat of isis is achieved it will soon have two he said in tillerson’s telling such a complete victory — over isis or iranian forces in the country — depends on the success of a broader effort to bring peace and stability to syria ungoverned spaces especially in conflict zones are breeding grounds for isis and other terrorist organizations he said us disengagement from syria would provide iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in syria as we have seen from iran’s proxy wars and public announcements iran seeks dominance in the middle east and the destruction of our ally israel as a destabilized nation and one bordering israel syria presents an opportunity that iran is all too eager to exploit the unveiling of the plan could renew congressional interest in crafting a new legislation defining the president’s legal authority to conduct counterterrorism operations for years lawmakers in both parties have struggled to agree on the details of a new authorization of the use of military force congress has been unable to bridge the gap between those who see a new aumf as primarily an opportunity to limit the president and those who believe constraining the commander in chief in wartime is unwise senate foreign relations chairman bob corker rtenn said during a recent hearing tillerson’s announcement is sure to spark a new round of debate on the policy though the state and defense departments must immediately consult with the members of the senate foreign relations committee which retains jurisdiction over the use of military force cardin said', 'something is wrong at newsweek and whoever is in charge over there needs to get a handle on the situation its most recent misstep occurred this week when its social media team tweeted this misleading headline \"fact check no the clintons were not paid millions by russia\" the accompanying article proves nothing of the sort the supposed fact check comes in response to a tweet this week from president trump that read \"russia sent millions to clinton foundation\" foxandfriends \"russia sent millions to clinton foundation\"— donald j trump realdonaldtrump date he is not wrong and the newsweek article acknowledges as much it acknowledges that former president bill clinton received a generous num speaking fee in num from a kremlinlinked bank with ties to uranium one a canadian uranium company that had mines in the us the newsweek article also acknowledges a separate new york times report that showed uranium ones chairman donated approximately num million to the clinton foundation in four separate installments as his company was being acquired by a russian nuclear energy firm called rosatom theres more from the times report and none of it reflects well on the clintons as the russians gradually assumed control of uranium one in three separate transactions date to num canadian records show a flow of cash made its way to the clinton foundation uranium ones chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling num million those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the clintons despite an agreement mrs clinton had struck with the obama white house to publicly identify all donors other people with ties to the company made donations as well the only thing the newsweek fact check disputes is whether the millions paid had anything to do with rosatoms successful efforts to secure approval from the state department to acquire uranium one the us committee on foreign investment gave the goahead in octdate handing the russian stateowned nuclear agency control of num percent of the uranium in america its unclear whether the russian cash given to the clinton foundation had anything to do with bill clintons attempts in num to facilitate meetings with rosatom executives its also unclear whether the payments had anything to do with his decision to meet privately with russian president vladimir putin that same year but this is still a long way off from \"fact check no the clintons were not paid millions by russia\" aggravatingly enough the headline that appears on newsweeks website is evenhanded and reasonable it reads simply \"did russia send money to bill clintons foundation like trump says factchecking the presidents claim\" its the social media version of this headline thats atrocious that said like the tweeted headline the body of the fact check also makes claims that it cant quite back including \"president is stretching the truth about the clinton foundation and money it received\" well perhaps but the clinton foundation did take in millions from the russians thats what the president tweeted heres how the newsweek fact check concludes \"yes the foundation received money and bill clinton was paid to give a speech but theres no evidence the clintons were paid by russians to push through the uranium deal\" this is correct and itd probably be devastating were it a thing the president actually said but he didnt quite say that he implied it sure but whats the use of fact checking things that havent been said', 'american forces made one of their most effective hits against the islamic state on nov num when us planes destroyed num tanker trucks used by the terrorist organization to transport the stolen oil that is its

asked operation inherent resolve spokesman col steve warren \"frankly the aircraft expended numpound bombs and all of their ammunition\" warren answered \"so they — they shot everything they had and then they had to go home\" journalists had another question if oil is vitally important to the islamic state why didnt the us hit the tanker trucks long ago given that the american antiisis operation began in septedate \"if its so important to cut off the oil shipments the critical revenue source for isis why did it take so long to take out num oil tanker trucks\" a reporter asked warren explained that american officials were deeply worried about harming the truck drivers who were working for the islamic state but might not be isis themselves us officials settled on a plan to drop leaflets on the trucks about num minutes before the raid warning the drivers that an attack was coming while us pilots flew low passes over the area planning all that took time \"this is our first strike against tanker trucks\" warren said \"we have been striking oil infrastructure targets since the very beginning of this operation what we found out was that many of our strikes were only minimally effective we would strike pieces of the oil infrastructure that were easily repaired\" warren said us officials conducted a study and decided to focus on the islamic states oil distribution network — trucks but the problem was the drivers \"we have not struck these trucks before\" warren said \"we assessed that these trucks while although they are being used for operations that support isil the truck drivers themselves are probably not members of isil theyre probably just civilians so we had to figure out a way around that were not in this business to kill civilians were in this business to stop isil — to defeat isil\" american officials decided on the leafletandbuzz plan \"we spent some time developing  the leaflets the low pass\" warren said \"we did some  some strafe runs as well — to kind of shoo people away without harming them so we had to go through that whole process of one determining whether or not we felt it was in our best interest to strike these trucks and then once we determined that yes it is in our interest to strike these trucks how do we go about ensuring that were able to mitigate the potential of civilian casualties and these things take time\" finally when all the work had been done num islamic state trucks were found in one place it was an inviting target \"these trucks were queued up\" warren said \"they were sitting sort of on flat desert there wasnt really anything recognizable as a road around it was just out there on the desert floor in the vicinity of one of these oil fields one of these oil facilities that weve been striking so they were queued up there waiting to take on their illicit oil  so these trucks were — they were just sitting there not moving\" it was an extraordinary opportunity to take out somewhere between onequarter and onethird of the islamic states entire truck fleet and after destroying num the americans ran out of ammunition the remaining num trucks were not destroyed beyond the outofammo problem reporters raised the issue of the us forces extreme care in avoiding civilian casualties if american forces wont hit any target if there is any fear that any nonisis person might be harmed might that not prolong the time it takes to destroy the islamic state which is killing civilians right and left \"is there a catchnum about not striking civilians and avoiding civilian casualties when over the past year the num million in oil revenue generated has been going to killing a large number of civilians\" a reporter asked \"is there any risk that avoiding civilian casualties is actually prolonging more civilian casualties\" that was a very thoughtful question warren conceded and an issue american war planners think about constantly but warren didnt have an answer \"its something that we wrestle with every day\" he said', 'in less than one year we are seeing our country go from a nation of laws to a nation of men obama a community organizer with his regime in congress is the one making the laws for all of us to obey with or without constitutional authority to do so have the american voters gone completely insane not the least of these laws include using the epa to dictate and enforce draconian regulations in the name of the global warming hoax whether congress passes cap and trade or not with the congressional clean water restoration act the obama regime intends to take over all water resources from coast to coast including the land these resources occupy and sustain more on this in my next column and now the house of pelosi has rammed through barney frank’s financial services bill which gives the keys to the treasury to lord obama forever and gives acorn a seat on the financial services board i can’t decide if obama is the biggest fool in history or the biggest liar in history he seems to believe all of the ridiculous statements he uses in his speeches  or is it that he reads the teleprompter so well that he thinks we will believe he is sincere he frequently uses conservative sounding phrases and later follows them with contradictory socialist statements that marginalize or compromise what he previously said he is a better doubletalker than john kerry was but no more believable my reason for questioning his sincerity should be obvious to most people who read this obama consistently says one thing to the cameras while doing just the opposite for example he says he is trying to curb the recession and create jobs while his policies are doing just the opposite the only jobs he is interested in creating are government jobs while he does nothing to encourage hiring in the private sector  which continues to lose jobs he says one of his highest priorities is to control spending and bring down the budget deficit and national debt then he and his congressional cabal go about their excessive spending and borrowing practices as though there were no tomorrow the spending they have legislated is unsustainable and the debt they have run up is unrecoverable is he so foolish to believe that the programs his advisors are giving him will really do what he says they will do or is he deliberately lying to the american people to hide a sinister marxist agenda what we do know is that obama is a marxist as are his advisors their political philosophy and policies come straight out of saul alinsky’s rules for radicals and clowardpiven with pushes shoves and nudges by george soros and cass sunstein the last time americans were faced with this kind of oppressive government the revolutionary war was the result which led to the crafting of our declaration of independence num and our constitution in num my apologies for the stupid error in my last column dating the constitution as num we may have to face this real crisis again but won’t have to write new documents this time we need only to enforce the ones we already have  the ones that the obama regime is determined to ignore or overrule when our founding fathers declared their independence from the king of england they claimed taxation without representation today we are being victimized and oppressed by the obama regime for the same reason our money is being taken and nothing we want is being provided in return on the contrary they are using it for things we emphatically oppose and strapping our citizens with unconscionable debt they are grabbing every dollar and every ounce of credit they can to spend this country into insolvency now they want to increase the national debt ceiling from num trillion to num trillion just to cover the entitlement programs already on the books until after the coming novedate elections in spite of obama‘s num statement on the senate floor raising america’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure the current national debt is at num trillion and at the current rate of spending the num trillion ceiling will be reached in january adding another trillion to the debt ceiling would last only until num months before the next election that wouldn’t be good for democrat reelection chances so if they increase it now by num trillion they hope no one will notice or if they do they won’t remember next november this additional debt should last until the end of num well after the elections the socialists have done nothing absolutely nothing to reduce the budget the national debt or their spending even the tarp loan payback money that banks have repaid to the government  which was supposed to go back into the treasury to help reduce the deficit  has been stolen by the obama regime and diverted to his government job creation program or in other words to his environmental and union supporters and other special interest lobbies moody’s investors service says the us and uk may loose their triplea

problem of government overspending with dramatic increases in government overspending he prides himself on removing num million from a num billion wasteful spending bill this is insane so in a year from now when the debt reaches num trillion what then just do it again where does it end what is the end game when will the goal of a clowardpiven financial collapse finally be realized will it happen before the next election how long will it be before this imitation president declares to the country that the government has no choice but to take over all private sector business and industry and consequently redistribute the wealth in order to save the country  or is it to save the planet closer to the truth would be to secure permanent political power for the socialist left if you haven’t

constitution’s principle author james madison wrote the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined and will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce concerning the legislature’s authority thomas jefferson asserted giving congress a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which may be good for the union would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless it would reduce the whole constitution to a single phrase that of instituting a congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the united states and as sole judges of the good or evil it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please certainly no such universal power was meant to be given them the constitution was intended to lace them up straightly within the enumerated powers and those without which as means these powers could not be carried into effect madison added if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money and will promote the general welfare the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions if you quoted these verses to those in power today they would think you were nuts madam pelosi as much as said so when asked to state

it is up to informed citizens working with local public officials to protect our own interests here are four common ways our government deceives the american people cherrypicked reports when federal agencies start projects the public may reject they often cite research studies proving the wisdom and importance of their program this research also demonstrates the agency’s professionalism and due diligence but their studies often are little more than weak justifications for programs that frequently cause more harm than benefit to communities and to the intended beneficiaries one example is hud’s move to opportunity mto a revdate randomized social experiment that transferred lowincome families into higher income areas to improve access to better education and jobs a num hud report revealed the mto program did reduce the incidence of extreme obesity and major depression among the randomized families but according to the analysis after num years the project failed to improve education employment or income outcomes food stamp usage rose and males in the experimental group were arrested more often than those in the control group primarily for property crimes and were also more likely to engage in a variety of other delinquent and risky behaviours the blatant failures did not dissuade hud who has now reintroduced the program sdate a series of new studies microanalyzed the original results each finding a positive nugget among the dismal results finally an audate report effects of exposure to better neighborhoods concluded that under mto children below the age of num earned more money were more likely to attend college and the girls were less likely to become single mothers the groundbreaking study virtually ignored the negatives from the original research and wasted few sentences on the plights of children over num who reported lower incomes and worse outcomes than had they never moved hud officials also disregarded the report’s most critical observation that the mto experimental design cannot be used to conclusively establish that childhood exposure to a better environment has a causal effect on longterm outcomes… hud is proceeding with a program that after num years researchers can show no conclusive proof works there are broader concerns the administration ignores aggressive pursuit of methods to reduce the incidence of single parent families and increase local educational opportunities even though researchers recognize both as solutions to improving educational outcomes that are more important than incomes is hud even within its legal bounds hud is advancing the mto program under its affirmatively furthering fair housing rule yet nothing in the fair housing act entitles hud to transfer people to gain income integration nor engage in many of the actions they are taking under affh continued below hear no research see no research hud and the department of education believe poor student performance is primarily the result of living in concentrated areas of poverty to remedy this the agency intends to relocate lowincome families to better neighborhoods to improve educational and income outcomes to a lowincome family this seems like a boon who would not want to move to a nicer area especially if someone else is paying for it but to conclude that moving to affluent areas is the best solution to improve outcomes hud had to ignore volumes of research findings that prove location is not the prime driver of scholastic ability moving families to locations where adults and children have no friends or relatives in areas they cannot afford brings its own challenges date study the effects of poverty on academic achievement concludes that income and a mother’s level of education are the significant factors in determining educational outcomes in many studies mother’s education had a more significant effect on children’s scores than income the author’s recommend that instructional techniques and strategies can help close the achievement gap by providing students with necessary assistance in order to achieve high standards in academic performance there is no recommendation to uproot families and move them to more affluent areas a num study sponsored by the prestigious harvard program on education policy and governance and education next reveals that a child’s educational disadvantages are more the result of their parents’ educational levels than where they live among students from families with low parental education us literacy proficiency is a disastrous num percent far below the num percent mark reached by students with high parent education while pursuing income diversity hud ignores that the best way to improve grades and opportunities is not to shuffle families into new neighborhoods

of education are moving ahead with regional equity assistance centers as part of president obama’s stronger together program see page num to teach local educators how to attain income diversity in classrooms as a means to improve educational outcomes twisted logic economic mobility is the reasoning behind one of the administration’s most aggressive programs to relocate lowincome families into better areas it sounds reasonable but ignores the real causes of economic immobility and deprives the next generation of the mental tools necessary to compete and succeed economic mobility is the ability of individuals to move up and down the earnings ladder greater mobility is associated with job opportunities wealth accumulation and personal freedom at one time americans easily migrated from the poor to the middle class but since date’s this has slowed until today the us is one of the least economically mobile of all first world nationsthe main causes for our immobility are technological advances that reduced the need for many middle income positions and more importantly a recession recovery that added high paying jobs for the upper class and service oriented work for lowincome brackets but little for the middle class with fewer middle class opportunities the poor are stuck with nowhere to advancethe administration is right to conclude that economic mobility is a factor of success but that success requires organic mobility not federally mandated mobility desiring striving and overcoming whatever disadvantages there may be is all part of the success modelto help poor

families they too will share the success of the higher earners under this logic you could even provide a study proving that the owners of their new subsidized bmw’s are more psychologically content arrive at work faster and return home early enough to spend more quality time with the family and help the kids with their schoolwork you can fool some of the people all of the time government agencies frequently mislead local public officials and the public by including wording in their documents that implies the opposite of what the regulation actually accomplishes a case in point is the administration’s affirmatively furthering fair housing rule that utilizes the fair housing act to eliminate segregation and discrimination while this seems like a good cause in practice the program does little to eliminate discrimination it does impose aggressive oversight over community planning during the regulatory comment period for affh astute responders questioned hud’s intrusion into local affairs and responsibilities particularly zoning the agency released this comforting statement this rule does not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government see page num but the statement is deceptive while hud does not directly impose land use decisions or zoning laws indirectly they can force you to impose them as this community discovered through charges of failure to affirmatively further fair housing civil rights violations threats to withdraw grant money and other legal actions hud can coerce communities into compliance with their zoning requirements even when the voters disagree it would be nice to think the agency only uses their authority in the face of flagrant civil rights violations that is not the case in westchester county ny in spite of being ontrack to meet a court settlement requiring the county build num new affordable homes the hud affiliated monitor wanted each community to adopt model zoning ordinances at one point the agency notified county executive rob astorino that ¼ acre building plots represented exclusionary zoning because lowincome families cannot afford them as hud expands their authority they also expand their interpretations of what constitutes segregation and discrimination leaving communities who accepted grants in a tenuous position these are only a handful of federal programs that cost taxpayers millions of wasted dollars programs like the economic recovery and reinvestment act affordable care act and common core have many many times this waste intentional misrepresentation and flawed

superpower based on the richness of its oil wealth after all this young democracy sits atop the world’s secondbiggest reserves of highquality petroleum iraq’s future seems bright indeed regardless of the current political squabbling the oilfueled iraqi economy continues to grow rapidly it’s perennially rated as one of the world’s top ten fastestgrowing economies and there’s plenty of room for additional expansion still in order to see the clearest view of what the iraqi economy may look like in five or ten years it’s helpful to take a look at the history of iraq’s oil industry as well as new oilfield technologies that are increasing iraqi production and revenues in part one we looked at the history of iraq’s oilbased economy as well as the political and economical developments leading up to the rise of saddam hussein and his control of the nation’s economy now let’s take a look at iraq’s oil industry and current economic outlook particularly what they mean for the value of the iraqi dinar beginning with the turning point of the coalition invasion in num which ousted saddam the beginning of the end for saddam the usled invasion and occupation of iraq quickly ended saddam hussein’s ruthless numyear regime and it was also the beginning of a new era for iraq’s longneglected oil industry with saddam and his cronies gone the nation soon entered a period of unprecedented economic growth fueled by its booming oil industry once the dust settled after date invasion american european and middle eastern oil companies quickly arrived ready for business there was much work to be done oil industry infrastructure in the kurdish region of northern iraq was relatively unscathed by actual fighting during war still oilfield equipment and facilities there suffered from years of neglect due to the shortage of replacement parts and new technologies made unavailable by the years of unimposed trade embargo and economic sanctions in southern and central iraq the scene was different between the gulf war of num and the fighting dudate approximately num of the oil production and refinery facilities in those regions were damaged apart from the impact of economic sanctions and war saddam himself stunted the country’s oil industry even further by mandating reservoirmanagement policies which resulted in lower production for several years after his departure wells were overpumped which in some cases permanently reduced their future outflows and in an attempt to boost yields lagging because of equipment maintenance issues the iraqi engineers reinjected excessive amounts of lowend petroleum fractions back into the ground reinjection is a standard industry technique for increasing a well’s output however the iraqi petroleum engineers reinjected overlyviscous oil constituents back into some wells which slowed output for several years after saddam’s departure huge reserves compensate for missteps regardless of the mismanagement under saddam the fact that iraq’s overall oil production has soared since his departure illustrates the enormity of iraq’s reserves and the resiliency of its industry in spite of thirty years of bungling iraq has been steadily achieving higher oil production totals almost every year since saddam’s demise according to conservative estimates dating to num iraq is believed to have at least num billion barrels of oil remaining to be tapped and several morerecent estimates have nearly doubled this figure geographically most of iraq’s known petroleum reserves lie in a belt that runs roughly north and south along the eastern side of the country iraq has at least num fields known to be super giants minimum num billion barrels each and another num+ giant fields minimum num billion barrels each leading petroleum engineers have indicated that southeastern iraq’s cluster of supergiant fields is the world’s largest concentration of such fields accounting for about num of the country’s reserves the remaining num of known reserves are found in the northern region of kirkuk khanaqin and mosul and there seems to be plenty of room for more oil discoveries  iraq is unique because only a tiny fraction of its known reserves are under development even though it already exports enormous amounts of crude oil as development continues more oil gushes forth in fact sdate only about num wells have been drilled throughout iraq in comparison approximately one million wells have already been drilled in the state of texas alone iraq is also full of gas the country’s proven reserves of natural gas are approximately num trillion cubic feet which is the fifthlargest in the world about twothirds of these known gas reserves are located in southern iraq and the rest in the north back to work in any event as soon as saddam was gone the iraqi oil industry began returning to normal during the years betdate date iraq was busily repairing both its civilian infrastructure damaged by the war as well as upgrading its longneglected oilfields in num the iraqi government announced a new plan to work with the world’s largest oil companies  shell exxonmobil bp and total who were the original partners in the iraq petroleum company ipc dating back to num this plan was quickly replaced by an even larger more comprehensive plan to develop iraq’s oilfields in num the iraqi ministry of oil formally awarded service contracts to these original big oil companies as well as several other international firms including chevron the oilfields under contract for development include iraq’s supergiant fields halfaya majnoon west qurna and rumaila the china national petroleum corporation cnpc and bp won the contract to develop the rumaila field which is iraq’s largest single field as a result of these agreements iraq was able to increase its production dramatically by num iraq had risen from nearzero production at the end of saddam’s reign to become the world’s twelfthlargest producer in num the us government allocated num billion to help develop and modernize the iraqi oil and gas industry although its direct involvement in managing that industry ended in num by the end of num iraqi oil production had risen to nearly num million barrels per day then in num another milestone was reached production averaged num million barrels per day a level not achieved sdate in num a brief glitch arose when the kurdistan regional government krg seized control of several northern oilfields in a dispute with the central government in baghdad regarding revenues fortunately in edate was at least temporarily resolved and oil flows have returned to normal since then newer technologies boost iraqi output as of num iraqi oil production is already benefiting from new technologies which had been unavailable during the years of the un trade embargo during the past few years these newer technologies have been introduced into iraq by the international oil companies that have been using such methods to increase oilfield yields in other countries given iraq’s huge reserves the nation’s oil industry will certainly to gain the maximum benefit from these technologies the most important new technologies are directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing both of which promise to help boost iraqi production and exports significantly directional drilling before dates most wells were drilled vertically that is a hole was drilled straight downward until it reached oil or not then in num several drilling companies developed techniques for slant drilling which was an early form of directional drilling that allowed the hole to be drilled at a slight angle directional drilling equipment allows a drill bit to move in a curving line rather than a straight line so it can snake its way around underground obstacles such as unusually hard rock formations in fact given enough depth wells can be drilled horizontally that is parallel to the surface of the land above the first practical benefit of directional drilling is that it allows drillers to reach oil reservoirs several miles away from the site of the drilling rig current technology allows drillers to drill as far as num miles away laterally so for example directional drilling allows landbased rigs to drill in offshore locations which significantly reduces production expenses and oil located under steep mountains can likewise be tapped from nearby flatlands most importantly in iraq directional drilling allows producers to increase the length of underground pipe exposed to the reservoir instead of simply having the very end of the pipe inserted into an oil reservoir with directional drilling a fairly long perforated section of the pipe is placed in contact with the oil this is critically important for ensuring high flows once a well is completed since oil can be sucked in through a much larger surface area in iraq directional drilling enables producers to overcome the sluggish flows which had resulted from saddam’s policy of overdrawing oil from wells and then reinjecting thick undesirable residues back into the ground in hopes of obtaining shortterm increases in flow as mentioned above and directional drilling also makes it possible for multiple wellheads to draw oil from a single drilling site so the extended length of perforated pipe exposed to the oil in the reservoir means greater yields likewise directional drilling also allows a single wellhead to draw oil andor gas from within several different geologic strata layers of rock at different depths something which is impossible with older perpendicular drilling methods the introduction of directional drilling technologies has helped iraq dramatically increase its production and these technologies hold the promise of even greater yields in the future hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing sometimes also called fracking is a method for stimulating wells to produce more oil the effectiveness of fracking was discovered during a series of experiments in num and the first commercial application came in num although some communities in the us have debated the use of fracking for our domestic production in iraq the practice is a potential godsend because it may allow oil producers to significantly increase their wells’ outputs water containing a suspension of sand and other constituents is injected under high pressure down into a well in order to create cracks in the oilbearing rock these cracks allow oil to flow more freely within the underground reservoir and therefore more can be extracted a hydraulic fracture is created underground by pumping the fracturing fluid into the wellbore in order to increase the underground pressure enough to crack rock as the rock cracks the fracturing fluid continues onward extending the cracking further and further fracking equipment can operate at pressures and flow rates of up to num pounds of pressure per square inch psi with inbound flows of fracking fluid as high as num barrels per minute sand and other materials called proppants are added to the fracking fluid in order to prop open the cracks already created so they won’t close while the oil is flowing outward these proppedopen fractures allow oil and gas trapped within rock to more easily flow outward it’s been estimated that fracking increases oil production by an average of about num and natural gas production by an average of num most importantly when used together fracking and directional drilling have a synergistic effect  the yields with both together may be substantially higher than if each were used separately the outlook given its huge oil reserves and the longterm commitments by international oil companies to develop its oil and gas fields iraq is certain to have a bright economic future as measured by its everincreasing volume of oil exports the country’s oil industry has fully recovered from the damage and mismanagement that it suffered during saddam hussein’s reign notwithstanding iraq’s alreadyknown reserves it seems likely that recent new exploration efforts by oil companies will lead to an even greater tally of iraq’s oil wealth it’s also important to note that iraq isn’t just blessed with large reserves it also happens that the geologic formations holding iraq’s oil are much more accessible to drilling than they are in most countries which means the costs of extracting that oil are much lower this is significant because iraq can profitably produce petroleum at prices of less than num per barrel in contrast us shale oil costs between num to num per barrel to produce and even the most costeffective wells in texas generally require a global oil price of at least num per barrel in order to be profitable so iraq can afford to pump and sell oil at prices below those of most other producing nations these production advantages have been visible during the recent saudi arabian oilproduction war designed to bankrupt us shaleoil producers while oil producers in the us and elsewhere have been severely impacted by the saudis’ overproduction iraq continues to produce profitably oil drives the iraqi dinar given the world’s insatiable appetite for oil and gas iraq’s dominant supply role is likely to become even stronger going forward although it’s difficult to predict the future with certainty it seems likely that sometime in the near future iraq will grow into a regional and international energy superpower based on its rich reserves in fact iraq seems ontrack to replace saudi arabia as the region’s wealthiest mostdeveloped nation within the next few years what does this mean for the dinar a nation’s economy as well as the value of its currency depends on its natural resources iraq’s exceptionally large oil reserves are like money in the bank available to meet the young democracy’s needs as it continues to grow eventually the value of the iraqi dinar should rise to reflect the true value of the country’s oil wealth this seems likeliest to occur once the central

phoenix arizona airport tarmac têteàtête between then attorney general loretta lynch and her boss’ predecessor former president bill clinton according to judicial watch’s director of communications jill farrell perusal of these latest government documents reveals that then fbi director james comey and his underlings were more concerned about leaks of that meeting being reported in the media than the actual lynchclinton meeting itself the new documents also show that thenfbi director comey seemed to learn of the meeting from news reports the new documents were obtained by judicial watch in response to a freedom of information act foia lawsuit filed after the justice department failed to comply with a date foia request seeking all fdnum forms prepared pursuant to the federal bureau of investigation’s investigation of former secretary of state hillary clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure all records of communications between any agent employee or representative of the federal bureau of investigation regarding concerning or related to the aforementioned investigation this request includes but is not limited to any related communications with any official employee or representative of the department of justice the executive office of the president the democratic national committee andor the presidential campaign of hillary clinton all records related to the meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton on date these latest fbi documents show how the agency’s officials were concerned about a leak that bill clinton delayed his aircraft taking off in order to maneuver a private meeting with his predecessor’s attorney general the breaking story in the observer is seemingly confirmed and causes a flurry of emails about the source of the article fbi officials write we need to find that guy and that the phoenix fbi office was contacted in an attempt to stem any further damage another fbi official working on ag lynch’s security detail suggests instituting nondisclosure agreements the names of the emails authors are redacted there are no documents showing concern about the meeting itself the fbi has allowed itself to become as corrupt as the criminals they arrest the fbi officials appeared at first to be deceptive with judicial watch by claiming they could not locate any records related to the tarmac meeting however in a related legal action the justice department claimed it located emails in which justice department officials communicated with the fbi and admitted that they had communicated with the fbi as a result by letter dated date from the fbi officials stated upon further review we subsequently determined potentially responsive documents may exist as a result your foia request has been reopened… on date attorney general loretta lynch met with former president bill clinton on board a parked plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clinton’s email server and only a few days before she was interviewed the justice department and fbi judicial watch filed a request on date that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate the suspiciously timed meeting between the head of the government agency investigating a presidential candidate’s suspected criminal acts and the candidate’s husband who was a twoterm potus the tarmac meeting also came just days before former fbi director james comey held the date press conference in which he announced that no charges would be filed against mrs clinton in his subsequent date testimony before the senate judiciary committee comey claimed the lynchclinton tarmac meeting was the capper among a number of things that had caused him to determine that department of justice leadership could not credibly complete the investigation and decline prosecution without grievous damage to the american people’s confidence in the justice system jill farrell noted in her released statement these new fbi documents show the fbi was more concerned about a whistleblower who told the truth about the infamous clintonlynch tarmac meeting than the scandalous meeting itself said judicial watch president tom fitton the documents show the fbi worked to make sure no more details of the meeting would be revealed to the american people no wonder the fbi didn’t turn these documents over until judicial watch caught the agency redhanded hiding them these new documents confirm the urgent need to reopen the clinton email scandal and criminally

inspectors generals describe atmosphere of restricted access inspectors general yes that’s the plural are considered watchdogs for the government their jobs primarily focus on uncovering waste fraud and mismanagement which is an important function to keep government programs and agencies in check a serious breach of trust is evident therefore when num of num inspectors general pen a letter to congress describing serious limitations on access to records that’s num of the total watchdogs who express such concerns you can read the letter here the letter takes aim at primarily three agencies the general at the peace corps the environmental protection agency and the department of justice these inspectors general recently faced restrictions on their access to certain records available to their agencies that were needed to perform their oversight work in critical areas the restrictions were not limited to just those inspectors general hence the overwhelming need to pen a letter to congress the inspectors general described how other inspectors general have from time to time faced similar obstacles to their work whether on a claim that some other law or principle trumped the clear mandate of the ig act or by the agency’s imposition of unnecessarily burdensome administrative conditions on access even when we are ultimately able toresolve these issues with senior agency leadership the process is often lengthy delays our work and diverts time and attention from substantive oversight activities this plainly is not what congress intended when it passed the ig act the inspector general act of num is clear the pertinent statute that relates to access is section §num authority of inspector general information and assistance from federal agencies unreasonable refusal office space and equipment it patently states a in addition to the authority otherwise provided by this act each inspector general in carrying out the provisions of this act is authorized— num to have access to all records reports audits reviews documents papers recommendations or other material available to the applicable establishment which relate to programs and operations with respect to which that inspector general has responsibilities under this act the full text of the law can be found here the letter to congress was addressed to the honorable darrell issa the honorable thomas r carper the honorable elijah cummings and the honorable tom coburn what made the letter particularly notable however was its size and scope darrell issa described i’ve never seen a letter like this and my folks have checked—there has never been a letter even with a dozen igs complaining this is the majority of all inspectors general saying not just in the examples they gave but government wide they see a pattern that is making them unable to do their job reading the official website for inspectors general one can see they pride themselves on service whose primary responsibilities to the american public are to detect and prevent fraud waste abuse and violations of law and to promote economy efficiency and effectiveness in the operations of the federal government the fact that the majority of the inspectors general find themselves unable to perform their duties to audit the federal government is quite troubling because it is another example of the most transparent administration choosing to willfully cloak themselves in secrecy stonewalling the very agents—who have a duty to the american people to keep government in check—is another tactical abuse of power alan joel has been a

stocks are next authored by turd ferguson via tfmetalsreportcom as mentioned at the beginning of this podcast we are all indebted to john and steve for their regular weekly discussions their podcasts offer the only fair and balanced coverage of the new cold war that you will find anywhere in the western media rather than a simple regurgitation of the war party line john and steve consider the conflict from the historical perspective of each side thus in listening to them over the past four years i almost feel as if i have participated in a graduatelevel russian studies class download podcast right click + ‘save as’ to be certain that this discussion is as widelyheard as possible i’ve taken the additional step of transcribing portions of the audio we begin with professor cohen providing some historical background regarding ukraine russia and the runup of this new cold war i’ve been working in print and broadcast about the onset of a new cold war since dates because i saw the clinton administration’s intrusive policies and then yeltsin’s russia as generating a backlash that would lead the two countries to a replication or continuation of the numyear cold war that reagan and gorbachev and then the first president bush said they had ended in numnum and that has unfolded more or less in the worst ways that i worried about i don’t think anybody would deny that they we’re in a new cold war i think they’re slow in acknowledging that it’s even more dangerous in various ways and reasons than was the numyear cold war but one reason is this was not the case during the old cold war is that we are militarily eyeballtoeyeball with russia and on three new cold war fronts one of course is ukraine which in a way is the epicenter but because of nato’s i think reckless military buildup on russia’s western borders particularly in the baltic regions region but also to a certain extent in syria where the situation is very fluid and still dangerous the cold war could erupt into an actual hot war very easily and i guess though the danger seemed maybe a year ago would be first and foremost in syria because ukraine sdate seemed rather frozen now it’s shifted back to ukraine we’ve got to stop and think what that means ukraine as a nation and then as a state following the end of the soviet union in num was always fraught with historical religious ethnic economic and political divisions simply holding ukraine together as a unitary state was going to be a problem but everyone managed it wasn’t pretty but they managed until the events of num when we all remember the maidan protest and let’s remember what they were about…the legallyconstitutionally elected president of ukraine viktor yanukovych declined to sign a socalled european union partnership agreement it was just said to be civilizational and economic and it was said that that would bring ukraine into european civilization and of course away from russia now ukraine and russia had been bound at the hip people don’t mention this often but there are tens of millions of intermarriages it’s hard not to go to moscow and spend some time and not find someone who’s got a ukrainian and russian parent or grandparent but this happened and it also needs to be removed reminded that yanukovych did not refuse to sign that agreement he simply asked for more time but that set off protests driven by all sorts of people some benign democratic seeking liberals fine people in ukraine but also by people who were by any definition ultranationalists and even quasifascist neonazis and that led of course to the confrontation where yanukovych was driven illegally off a new illegal government was formed backed by the united states and europe russia for various reasons that i think were legitimate feared that the unrest would spread to the historical russian peninsula of crimea which for most of its history for centuries had been part of russia but because of a kind of fluke was now territorially part of ukraine the russians therefore welcomed and encouraged a referendum in crimea by all standards including gallup polls that were taken later more than num percent voted to join russia and so russia legally annexed in num…they don’t call it annex they call it reunited with crimea meanwhile the mostly russian provinces of donbass part of crimea objected to the coup in kiev that had overthrown the president they had voted for yanukovych his electorate was not only in southeastern ukraine but it was primarily there so they believed that their president had been overthrown and a rebellion began backed by russia of course and the war has gone on now nearly four years the official number of dead is num but it’s surely many more and perhaps num million people who lived in southeastern ukraine have been displaced most of them gone to russia incidentally russia gets no credit for the very humanitarian way they have handled all these people refugees who fled to russia now of course it was easier because they were russian speakers but a great many of them have rebuilt their lives vocationally and in terms of their family in russia and whether they’ll ever go back to ukraine is not clear so that’s where the situation was kind of frozen there was this agreement as you know called the minsk num agreement that all the european powers agreed to there the president of ukraine poroshenko agreed to it and that putin agreed too for resolution of the crisis and it called for two things…a cessation along a designated line of the fighting and kiev’s agreement that donbass would be given home rule to remain within what would essentially be a federated ukrainian state no one has ever suggested a better or alternative solution to that during the years since minsk was formalized in num by all evidence it seems both sides have violated the agreement but kiev has refused to grant any home rule to the rebel provinces and that we know from history whether it’s from the irish civil war or other diverse countries is the only way to save a state is to make it a federation but the opposition to it in ukraine among ultraright is enormous president poroshenko is weak both as a person and as a leader and in terms of his public support at home the united states has done nothing to encourage the real implication of minsk and so it remains this hot front and one could imagine all sorts of bad outcomes because it’s now a proxy war in donbass that is the rebels were backed by russia kiev is backed by the united states and that proxy war could become a direct war and a final point and this has been long winded but when is that ever since obama was trying to figure out what to do about ukraine the idea of the united states sending more and higher quality weapons to kiev to presumably suppress the rebellion in donbass though formally it said to ward off a new russian attack of which there is no evidence or intention obama refused to do it send heavy weapons he was under enormous pressure especially from the liberal wing of the democratic party which has become very hawkish and he refused to do that it seemed clear from donald trump’s campaign that he would never do it because he wanted to cooperate with russia and yet he has been compelled i think to agree to send weapons to kiev when and what they’ll send isn’t yet clear but he can only make matters worse really matters worse and that’s where we are today the discussion then turns to the present day the narrative in the west is that russia seized crimea as some sort of postsoviet expansion where putin must be stopped as he is desperately trying to recreate the borders of the old soviet union at tfmr we have always felt that this was bogus and that it failed to acknowledge any context from the russian point of view professor cohen resumes the situation from the russian point of view was even worse i mean crimea…and for to understand this you have to know russian history know russians and know crimea…crimea historically culturally was such a part of russia for so many centuries right through the soviet period that it would be…this is a bit of a stretch as if to say that texas because it once belonged to mexico…was not authentically indigenously a native part of america but even more because the cultural romance of crimea the site i mean the home of chekov’s dacha was in yalta it’s iconic in russian history russian culture and russian sentiment it wasn’t just the naval base at sebastopol which was vitally important although the russians which had been leasing the naval base and by the way what happened at maidan called into question whether kiev would honor that long term lease any longer you’re absolutely right about that russia was building in the far north an alternative naval base i mean technically it could have replicated crimea strategically it could have done this but it could never have replicated crimea in the hearts and minds of russians and as poll after poll and the referendum showed in the hearts and minds of some num percent of the crimean people now crimea also has tartar crimeans and ukrainians who don’t share this view but the overwhelming majority of crimeans who were born there or moved there or lived there for decades that was their sentiment now here’s the political background nonetheless in all the years i’ve followed post soviet russia beginning in num i never saw any kremlin leadership give any indication that it was going to take crimea back let me repeat that you could not find certainly not in the public record…who knows what…dreams…you know these kinds of people have in the pentagon and elsewhere secretly in the dark of the night but neither yeltsin nor putin ever gave any public support to the idea which you could find in moscow and some intellectual circles that you know crimea is ours in fact at one point they needed to draw new maps because crimea was now no longer in russia adate and putin wrote to the president of crimea…i don’t recall which one it was saying hey our map people want to get on with the new maps could you get your map people to work with them because there’s a number of borders that aren’t clear and we’ve got to clarify them and he got no response in other words the notion that crimea might be taken or even negotiated back into russia simply was not on the political agenda for the kremlin under putin udate the final segment of the discussion deals with the future  + more specifically what if anything can be done by you and i…regular everyday people…to effect change and divert the war party from this path of destruction professor cohen had some thoughts there too i’m not a trump supporter and i didn’t vote for him however we can actually support donald trump’s campaign promise which i think he’s tried to act on since he’s been president that it’s necessary to cooperate with russia this is what was called detente in the 20th century i don’t know why trump doesn’t make this point i don’t think he has very good advisors in regard to russia either in terms of what’s going on in russia or in terms of his own policy making but trump might say in his own defense because they’re indicting him for simply saying i want to cooperate with russia and with putin in particular he could say look every republican president of consequence in the 20th century pursued detente with russia first eisenhower the first detente the spirit of camp david with khrushchev then the nixon kissinger attempt at a grand detente with brezhnev and finally above all ronald reagan a detente with gorbachev the last soviet leader soviet russian leader so great that reagan and gorbachev ended the cold war trump could put himself in that tradition and say i’m the traditional republican this is what eisenhower nixon and reagan did they did it wisely they avoided nuclear war with russia we’re in a new cold war the dangers are grave it’s not only my duty as the american president to pursue cooperation to ward off a catastrophe but i commend the honorable tradition of the republican party he doesn’t say that i don’t know why as i say it because he doesn’t know what or because he wants to be the one and only i have no idea what he needs to say and if he said it it would compel a conversation in washington that we’re not having what’s happened to detente and what’s happened is we have if we ignore his own idiom and put it in again i speak as a story in the historical language of 20th century diplomacy we have a prodetente president who for the first time in history is not permitted to at least try because every time he has a sensible conversation with putin no matter whether it’s face to face or on the telephone he’s accused not only by the traditionally crazies in american politics but by the new york times of treason so what we could do and it will be hard for a lot of people because of the loathing for trump is so pervasive just and i didn’t vote for trump is the fifth amendment i didn’t vote for trump and i didn’t support president trump but about this he is not only right he’s our only hope at the moment so one possibility is simply to say no matter all else we support donald trump’s attempt to cooperate with russia because it’s existential now would enough of us do that would a few newspapers do that would a few of these cable tv panelists would they ever have panelist on who would do that we might affect a little civic courage in congress where a few people there would do so also but at the moment you have a complete blackout on this perspective in the american political media arena and you have an utter lack of civic courage among political figures and editors who know better but have been frightened by this rush to do business unfortunately and that’s a pretty good summation obviously at num minutes there’s a lot more information here than what i’ve transcribed therefore i beg you please take the time this weekend to listen to this full podcast then when you’re finished please forward the audio to someone you know only through some sort grassroots dialogue will we be able to prevail against the war party and their march toward confrontation with russia as professor cohen states we face a very real and existential threat from this new cold war we must do all we can do to stop it before it becomes an outofcontrol hot war source url', 'like many conservatives who live amongst those who believe they own the franchise on enlightened thinking i have often been asked how in the world i could have voted for a fill in the progressive blank like george w bush for president remarkably the answer to that question is one that seems to have eluded most of these deep thinkers you mean how could i have voted for george w bush—as opposed to a hypocritical scold like al gore or a selfaggrandizing blowhard like john kerry i invariably respond unless you’ve has been living in an alternative universe you’re well aware of the avalanche of criticism directed at donald trump from all quarters liberal and conservative including the latest hypocritical screed by mitt romney yet despite that criticism virtually everyone engaged in it ignores the essential reality that attends every election context is everything in other words whatever one feels about donald trump or any other candidate for that matter the ultimate question and the answer to it cannot be postponed indefinitely as in donald trump—running against whom unfortunately john kerry remained true to his appetite for power and thus the american public remains afflicted with a secretary of state who needs additional evaluation undertaken before he can decide if the wholesale and systematic slaughter of christians in the middle east constitutes genocide a man who when informed that a former gitmo detainee had returned to terrorism epitomized the utter clueless of the entire obama administration’s foreign policy he’s not supposed to be doing that kerry stated that being said there is little doubt in my mind that a commanderinchief al gore or john kerry would have been worse leaders by several orders of magnitude gore had the decency to take his global warming hustle into the private sector where he made millions selling christianlike dispensations known as carbon credits to the terminally gullible unfortunately like his father george w believed maintaining comity with his democrat detractors was apparently more important that defending the most momentous decision any commanderinchief must make reneging on his no new taxes pledge to accommodate democrats—who savaged him in return—probably cost george hw bush date election george w’s flaccid response to reid and company gave us a democraticallycontrolled congress in num—and paved the way for the rise of barack obama in num let’s be clear here this is neither a ringing endorsement for what bush accomplished nor a knock on what i perceived as his major failings the foremost of which was allowing democrats to coopt the iraq war narrative without any substantive pushback when american men and women are in harm’s way allowing a slanderous hack like harry reid to declare the war lost even before the ultimately successful surge was completed was an unconscionable and unnecessary surrender it is pretty clear that eight years of the obama administration’s effort to fundamentally transform the united states of america into a socialist utopian paradise with a third world underpinning that millions of illegals represent has enraged millions of americans maybe even to the point as so many of trump’s critics point out where anger and frustration has completely supplanted anything resembling rational thinking anger and frustration about what how about a gop establishment that has made an utter mockery of their base’s support and is now in the process of going after that base’s preferred candidate with the kind of vigor and viciousness they have never directed at at barack obama or hillary clinton moreover what in the world do they think would happen if they purposely orchestrate a brokered convention where none of the current presidential candidates get the nomination they have to know that the number of conservatives who stayed home when milquetoast mitt polited his way to defeat would be dwarfed by the number who would stay home if an establishment gop candidate were forcefed to the base thus an inescapable conclusion arises the establishment gop would tolerate a president hillary clinton to maintain their control of the party—even if they run the party into the dustbin of history as a result that would be the same hillary clinton who believes the rule of law applies to everyone else but her and her husband the same hillary clinton who left four americans to die in benghazi and then lied about a video being the cause of their demise when her own communications with her daughter egyptian prime minister hisham kandil and the libyan president on the night of the attack indicated she knew otherwise a women who still can’t explain at the very least how highlyclassified emails migrated from wholly secure and selfcontained government servers to her personal one a woman with no discernible accomplishments as a senator and a track record of colossal failure as secretary of state a woman who successfully used the sexist card to bash every republican until trump came along and threw it right back in her predatorenabling face make no mistake this is not an endorsement of donald trump i’m not a big fan of the palookaville style of politics or the mudwrestling into which the republican primary season has devolved but if trump does make it to the finish line and hillary is his opponent then what if it comes down to these two who do you want picking the next supreme court justice—or three who do you want formulating immigration policy who has a better vision for our terminallyunderperforming economy who do you want defending america against islamist terror iranian nuclear ambitions and russian and chinese military expansionism who do you want restoring american exceptionalism someone who might believe in it or someone who clearly doesn’t the electorate has long been forced to choose between the lesser of two evils and there is little doubt this may very well prove to be the most pernicious choice in modern history but it remains a choice nonetheless maybe the most important one in a very long time thus it behooves every wouldbe voter to keep context in mind no matter how down and dirty date presidential campaign becomes in fact context is all that ultimately matters', 'the united states has slashed its contribution to the un relief and works agency for palestinian refugees by more than num million but still gave the agency num million that’s num million too much unrwa has become the poster child for un bureaucratic bloat mission creep and twisted morality unrwa was founded in num to help palestinian refugees displaced by israel’s war of independence even that decision was questionable after all putting israel’s creation aside in dates alone wars created more than num million refugees there was world war ii of course but date partition of india also displaced num million persons and created millions of refugees in the wake of israel’s creation arab states expelled hundreds of thousands of their jews this is why the un created the united nations high commissioner for refugees to be the permanent agency charged with refugee assistance and protection individual palestinian arab families suffered dislocation and tragedy but they were hardly alone they were alone however in having a un agency created to cater specifically to them still when the un created unrwa it was meant to be a temporary agency to address a temporary problem once it resettled palestinian refugees its job was done and it was to shut its doors forever and dissolve in a num report to the un general assembly unrwa reported there must be a firm goal of terminating relief operations sustained relief operations inevitably contain the germ of human deterioration it was right but arab state rejectionism got in the way arab states like egypt syria and iraq quickly concluded that they could use unrwa to perpetuate the problem to undercut normalization with israel and to transform an aid agency into a weapon against israel the rest is history both current unrwa commissioner general pierre krahenbuhl and unrwa spokesman chris gunness were born years after unrwa was meant to dissolve nor does unrwa’s track record make it worth saving while unhcr has resettled refugees and allowed them to get on with their lives unrwa has actively undercut settlement it has embraced a unique definition of refugee that differs with unhcr and that is used everywhere else in the world consider if india and pakistan used the same definition of refugee from their partition that unrwa embraces there would be more than num million refugees in south asia today unrwa has helped make the palestinians the largest per capita recipient of aid on earth but has the least to show for it the problem isn’t just waste of money however almost a quartercentury after the palestinian authority began unrwa has eroded rather than supported the foundations of good governance after all if unrwa promises to take care of housing education and support why shouldn’t both the palestinian authority and their sometimepartner hamas spend money on terror pensions terror tunnels and an arsenal of rockets add into the mix unrwa incompetence schools used as arsenals school books teaching incitement unrwa employees moonlighting as bomb makers and terror recruitment in unrwa high schools and the problem is even worse unrwa denials of complicity in such activities if taken at face value are just acknowledgment of its own poor oversight it’s long past time to cut off unrwa and ask unhcr to take over the palestinians deserve an apolitical agency rather than an amplifier for radicalism and waste unrwa has become a cancer not only for those who seek peace and reconciliation but also for the

and virginia a recent campaign stop in las vegas to help sen harry reid’s failing bid for reelection is driving reid even deeper into trouble byron dorgan d and christopher dodd d have announced unscheduled retirement due to unhappy constituents back home who intended to put them on the unemployment line come november even more moderate sen evan bayh d has announced his retirement despite leading in the polls and num million in his campaign war chest putting a fine point on his reasons for leaving bayh stated—after all these years my passion for service to my fellow citizens is undiminished but my desire to do so by serving in congress has waned for some time i have had a growing conviction that congress is not operating as it should there is too much partisanship and not enough progress—too much narrow ideology and not enough practical problemsolving even at a time of enormous challenge the peoples’ business is not being done two of the nation’s most progressive members of congress passed sen ted kennedy d and rep john murtha d another will be leaving due to health concerns as num year old new jersey sen frank lautenberg d announces a diagnosis of stomach cancer rumors of a coming shakeup in the white house staff persist and no obama insider appears safe at the moment with mounting public pressure to walk away from the heavyhanded pelosi partisanship that has left the people’s business tied up in dc gridlock like never before nobody’s messiah now obama can’t get a passing grade in any category today and the pelosi led congress is even more unpopular than what’s left of the man who was called a messiah only a year ago at any other time in us history predicting a complete republican sweep in date midterm elections would be a donedeal and no vegas oddsmaker would dare take a bet to the contrary date is the year of the tea party… inside the beltway politicos are growing increasingly desperate to figure out exactly who these tea party folks are and what they really want it’s not hard to figure out though… the tea party is made up of the num of americans who voted against this mess in num plus about half of the people who fell for obama’s centrist sounding campaign rhetoric only to find out after inauguration day that they had elected a marxist wrecking ball to power the tea party represents most americans of all political stripes though all constitutionally conscious and it can’t be hijacked or controlled by either political party so it must be put down hence news of the clintonistas cranking up the old warroom for an allout counterattack on the tea party movement demonstrates just how concerned the progressive left is at a time when it appears that democrats are not only likely to be replaced with republicans but constitutional conservatives…—god forbid the heavy marxist hand of obama pelosi and reid have certainly awakened the sleeping giant and carville and mcauliffe hope to put a chokehold on the movement before millions of angry americans can successfully snuff out the current march to marxism aka progress meanwhile even the most far left core supporters of the obamanation movement have lost hope for the kinds of change they thought certain with control of all branches of the fed in their death grip code pink is angry over obama’s surge in afghanistan which might be the only correct thing he’s done since taking office and the fact that he has made no progress in pulling out of iraq a war that was illegal under bush in the minds of code pinkos moveon is so desperate for a new messiah that even rocker john cougar mellencamp offers more hope from his little pink house than obama offers from the white house international socialists demanding the closure of club gitmo and civil rights for known terrorists are disappointed that obama has dropped the ball on setting those terrorists loose after an oj simpson styled public lashing of the us military nothing has gone well for obama he can’t even address his kids at the dinner table without a teleprompter and as a result people who foolishly placed their faith in a man from nowhere with a blank résumé a little over a year ago find themselves waking up to a nightmare of monumental proportions today and since obama  co have never run anything before they have no idea how to run the country now despite holding back numnum of the stimulus money to be spent during the election year aimed at creating another false impression of economic improvement before the election things can only get worse when spending us deeper into debt seems to be the only solution for every problem higher taxes more regulation and deeper debt spell disaster no matter what business you’re in… only if you live inside the dc beltway can you make any sense of that strategy but most americans don’t live inside the dc beltway and as dc elitists cinch the debt belt tighter and tighter around the neck of the average american sooner or later there will be no place to run and no place to hide from hero to zero in a single year  no former us president has ever fallen from grace faster prior to barack obama jimmy carter was the most unsuccessful president in us history but even carter looks bright compared to obama… with or without his traveling teleprompter he’s nobody’s messiah now…', 'subscribe to canada free press for free chance to learn

straight line and on curves mitsubishi winter driving event helps teach control on snow winter may be on its way outsoon but there’s still enough of the old person around to ensure that snowy canadian roads will be challenging for at least a few more weeks that means there’s still ample opportunity for more skidrelated fender benders before spring springs and the grass starts rizzing and to that end mitsubishi canada has been on the road as well bringing some professional drivers and some of their outlander suvcrossovers to alberta to not only showcase the crummy weather capabilities of their vehicles but to give some handy tips to attendees who find themselves oot and aboot when the white stuff sticks i love these events they’re not only fun but they can help you navigate the neige with more confidence and skill i did a similar type of thing a couple of years back when ford came through and will always show up for such events because you can never have too much practice  and it’s a real hoot sliding around a snowy open area in someone else’s vehicle and they treat you really nicely too so it was that mitsubishi and their folk armed with a squadron of outlanders came through calgary last saturday on the last leg of their three stop tour to wild rose country they were accompanied as well by representatives from morrisport advanced driving a group of personable driving experts with whom i’ve worked before as well the event kicked off with a short presentation by morrisport’s lawrence howlett who outlined what we could expect from the two hour session and then gave us some insight into such issues as proper seating position the physics of vehicle control and the benefits of such technologies as traction control and abs as well as mitsubishi’s systems of all wheel control there are actually two such systems  well one’s an enhancement of the other  available on the outlander and given mitsubishi’s legendary record when it comes to rallying the company appears to have gotten the technology down pat the basic awc sends torque when the vehicle’s electronic brain deems it necessary from the front to the rear axle to help ensure good traction when the front wheels the base model is a front driver  like many many others in the suvcrossover market these days start losing traction the super all wheel control that’s available on the gt trim level ups that ante by adding torque vectoring between the front left and right wheels as well for even better control when push comes to shove both systems work well as we noticed during the driving part of the event but the bottom line as always is the proverbial nut behind the wheel which meant the driving part of the experience was even more important because it gave us a chance to actually put the words into practice and so we did the event held at calgary’s winsport complex aka canada olympic park had us navigate a slalom course initially starting slowly and building up speed as we got comfortable thanks to fresh snow it was plenty slippery which of course worked to the benefit of the exercise but the combination of mitsubishi’s awc systems and the expert guidance meant that very few cones were clobbered from there we did an acceleration and braking course  basically a straight line between cones during which we peeled out as much as possible on snow surprisingly peelable thanks to the mits technology barrelled toward the braking zone then tromped on the pedal the first time was kind of tentative then we got faster and more aggressive on the brake pedal to showcase not only the outlanders’ performance but also to show us the difference between braking with and without using the antilock brake system i’ve always been of the opinion that if the traction control andor abs comes on then you aren’t doing your job as a driver but sometimes it’s nice to have the electronic robots on hand just in case this is especially true these days my first car with abs was an original generation infiniti q45 with first generation abs and traction control and it was more annoying than useful but those days appear to be long gone as technology has marched onward from there we went to a fork in the road event where we went like a bat out of hell toward said fork  laid out again with cones  the instructor waiting till the last minute to tell us if we should take the left or right fork or stay in the middle and stand on the brakes this not only taught us to listen and to pay attention it also helped showcase the benefits of looking as far down the road ahead of you as possible so you’re ready for whatever might happen in front of you the focus as it should be was on the importance of smoothness behind the steering wheel not just smoothness on the wheel itself though of course that’s critical but smoothness on the pedals as well sure the nannies and awc can help a lot but the bottom line as always is that the pilot in command is indeed in command and should take those responsibilities seriously continued below it reminds me of a line in the movie contact where the young girl heroine is trying to find people to talk to on her ham radio her dad tells her small moves meaning basically that being smooth and gentle on the tuning knob would help and it did she ended up in an aliendesigned space transport it’s the same with driving sure there are times when a panic stop or swerve might be necessary but the lion’s share of your time behind the wheel will be better and more efficient if you keep your eyes peeled on the conditions around you and as far ahead as you can see so that if you do need to make some kind of course correction you can do it with smaller more controlled  and smoother  moves racers such as the morrisport guys know and practice this and they helped attendees understand the concept before unleashing us to wreak our own special havoc on the snowy lot the bottom line of the event is that it gave those of us who were there a chance to learn about and practice  in a limited manner under controlled conditions  optimal steering wheel control vision and anticipation as well as some obstacle avoidance and emergency braking tactics in both a straight line and on curves you can do this on your own on any reasonably large snowcovered parking lot sure you may not have the expert guidance we had during mitsubishi’s event or a bunch of cones to lay out but any practice is good practice and if you can learn to control your vehicle better by doing a few donuts after the mall has closed for the day you’ll be more confident

bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by jayson veley  natural news most people never thought they would see the day that the fbi would become so politicized that many of its members actively lie and commit treason in an attempt to bring down the president of the united states but alas here we are while our criminal justice system was originally established to give all americans regardless of their background and political ideology fair and equal treatment under the law that all changed when barack obama became the 44th president of the united states with the department of justice under his control obama was able to appoint radical leftists like eric holder and loretta lynch to do his bidding which mostly consisted of racebaiting and using the law to specifically target conservative americans in this way the justice system became not only entangled in rampant corruption but also a weapon used by the left to destroy their political enemies today even though donald trump has taken over barack obama’s seat inside the oval office rogue obama appointees that still reside in the department of justice are doing what they’ve always done the only difference is that now they have the advantage of working to dismantle the conservative movement from within perhaps one of the most outrageous and desperate allegations made by the left in recent history is the idea that president trump and various members of his team colluded with the russians throughout date presidential election which ultimately helped trump defeat hillary clinton last november despite no concrete evidence whatsoever the liberals including and especially leftists within the mainstream media have been hellbent on convincing the american people that something illegal occurred eventually they were rewarded for their efforts with the appointment of special counsel robert mueller who has gone on to conduct one of the most biased and politicized fbi investigations in american history to give just one example it was recently revealed that a top fbi agent at the center of the investigation into the socalled russia collusion scandal peter strzok exchanged several antitrump text messages with fbi lawyer lisa page who was also appointed to mueller’s investigative team although strzok was suspended from the investigation for his overwhelming bias it goes to show that robert mueller really didn’t take enough time to ensure that his team was fair and honest in the first place related the bogus trumprussia collusion story is nothing but a political hatchet job cooked up by obama loyalist john brennan it’s also worth noting that peter strzok was the fbi’s lead investigator on the investigation into hillary clinton’s mishandling of classified emails during her time as secretary of state strzok even interviewed clinton on date just days before thenfbi director james comey announced that he would not be recommending any charges if peter strzok is this biased and this willing to defend liberal democrats why would robert mueller recruit him for his team of course peter strzok is only one of many individuals on robert mueller’s team that has an obvious leftwing slant fbi deputy director andrew mccabe for example was involved in both the investigation into hillary clinton’s email server and the investigation into the uranium one sale neither of which conveniently resulted in legal consequences for clinton mccabe’s wife also received roughly num from clinton supporters and leftwing organizations during her campaign for virginia state senate other people on mueller’s team with liberal biases include andrew weissmann justin cooper jeannie rhee bruce ohr and others if all of this isn’t enough to convince you that this entire

economic prism  goldseek the political differences of today’s leading two parties are not over ultimate questions of principles rather they’re over opposing answers to the question of how a goal can be achieved with the least sacrifice for lawmakers the goal is to promise the populace something for nothing while pretending to make good on it take the latest tax bill for instance the gop wants to tax less and spend more the democrat party wants to tax more and spend even more we don’t recall seeing any proposals to tax less spend less and shrink the size of the state and why would we today’s central planners and social engineers are enlightened and progressive they know much more about anything and everything than the rest of us in particular they share a general sense that they know how to spend your money better than you at best the central planners call your money to washington so they can then distribute it back to your friends and neighbors in reality the lawmakers call your money to washington where they distribute it to their friends and neighbors  not yours this is not a matter of opinion it’s a matter of fact is it a coincidence that the top three wealthiest counties in the country are in the shadow of the capitol in the dc suburbs what it is exactly that the residents of these counties do that’s of tangible value is unclear however what is clear is that bogus government jobs in loudoun county and fairfax county virginia pay big bucks but that’s not all… garbage in garbage out further up the eastern seaboard wall street has a good thing going too the big bankers and brokers make big bucks extracting capital from main street america that’s a fair characterization right perhaps the big bankers and brokers really are efficiently allocating capital to its highest and best use who knows but as far as we can tell they’re gambling with other people’s money  and collecting fees regardless of how their coin tosses fall it’s always ‘heads i win tails you lose’ not a bad fugazi gig if you can get it of course the cornerstone of it all is the federal reserve through what they call open market operations the fed rigs the game in washington’s and wall street’s favor indeed the process is really quite elegant under the smokescreen cover of garbage in economic data the fed’s economists produce garbage out bar charts and line graphs these in short are fabricated depictions of the economy’s growth consumer and producer prices personal consumption expenditures unemployment rate and whatever other aggregate metrics are deemed to be of vital importance what’s more these fabricated depictions serve as the basis for the fed’s monetary policy decisions do the graphs show price inflation heating up or cooling down what about gdp or the unemployment rate is one going up while the other’s going down is one going down while the other’s going up the federal open market committee fomc deliberates over these questions about every six weeks then the fed goes to work inflating the nation’s money supply with the occasional rug yank for the stated purpose of getting the charts and graphs to illustrate the garbage data to their liking what to make of it the rug yank phase of fed policy from the outside the fed’s economists and planners appear to be esteemed professionals making decisions with the intent of providing for the greater good of the country they even attend economic conferences and forums where they present their latest research findings on abstract topics like liquidity traps some of their studies even include footnotes as if the professional economists are building upon a concrete knowledge base of human intellect yet beneath this cover of bogus science the real sausage is made capital is borrowed into existence where it is directed to washington and wall street there having first dibs on this phony money washington and wall street get to spend it as if it has real value however the real value does not coming from the fed’s phony money in fact as this new phony money appears on the scene it extracts incremental wealth from the workers and producers across the country that  through their time talent and labor  created the wealth to begin with at the moment we’re in the rug yank phase of the fed’s monetary policy this is where they reel back credit ever so slightly after letting it run wild over the last

which includes three quarter percent hikes in num we wish powell the best in his endeavors but we suspect he’ll unwittingly pull the rug out from under financial markets and the economy before he

the world with numerous central banks beginning a coordinated fiscal tightening policy but it is far more likely that the international banking cabal is not oblivious to the effects of their own

to connecticut watersheds linked to increased risk of infection headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by russel davis  natural news connecticut residents living near the state’s rivers and within specific watersheds may want to steer clear of the water sources as a recently published study in the journal of infectious diseases discovered a link between close proximity to waterways and increased number of legionnaires’ disease infections the study carried out by a team of researchers at the yale school of public health the yale school of forestry  environmental studies and the connecticut department of public health was based on analyzed cases of nonoutbreak legionellosis that required hospital admissions between date and date data from the numyear study revealed that increased rainfall and stream flow were tied to an increase in legionnaires’ disease cases across the state likewise the research team found that natural water reservoirs played a central role on where people contract a respiratory disease called sporadic legionellosis the scientists also observed that people living within num miles of the quinebaug river and the hockanum brook had the highest likelihood of contracting the disease in contrast those living near the saugatuck river in western connecticut and the shetucket river in eastern connecticut had the lowest odds of having the illness according to the research team the increase in disease rates may be explained by two things bacterial aerosolization or residential water contamination the scientists explained that water could be aerosolized by power plants and sewage treatment plants that use rivers during the cooling and treatment processes which in turn can lead to immense bacterial proliferation as a result residential water supplies become more susceptible to contamination thus increasing the risk of infection our findings demonstrate that the natural environment could have a greater role in influencing the risk of disease than previously thought this contrasts with the common view that building water systems and cooling towers are the main source of exposure for many cases rivers and watersheds could be proxies for areas of heightened risk due to poorly treated drinking water or wellwater use defining the mechanism behind the link between rainfall and legionellosis is a next step and likely requires more investigation of the role of drinking water on sporadic cases of disease and how rainfall can affect water quality lead author kelsie cassell said in a press release however the scientists noted that more research is warranted to better determine whether rainfall and river turbulence could exacerbate bacterial aerosolization or residential water contamination cdc legionnaires’ outbreaks in the us increased nearly fourfold in num years a report by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc revealed that cases of legionnaires’ disease nearly quadrupled across the united states over a period of num years according to the report about num americans were diagnosed with the disease in num alone the cdc also stated that about num

of num the restrictions are reversible and could be lifted if the us backtracked on its policies in september the us warned russia that the restrictions on flights over the kaliningrad region  a noncontiguous section of russian territory squeezed between lithuania poland and the baltic sea  were seen as a violation of the treaty russia restricted flights over the kaliningrad region because some parties to the treaty crossed the length and breadth of the flight path causing problems in the use of the region’s limited airspace and to the kaliningrad international airport it prompted moscow to restrict the maximum flight distance over the kaliningrad region to num kilometres without changing the total flight distance of num km and hence coverage of russia’s territory the regulation does not run contrary to the ost or the signatories’ subsequent decisions the flight range of num km is sufficient for observing any part of the region the us canada turkey and georgia have established restrictions within the treaty on flying over their territories russia has been accused of the unlawful denial to permit observation flights in the num kilometer border area of the socalled georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia but the two entities are sovereign states recognized as such by russia the open sky treaty states that the flights must not violate a tenkilometer corridor along the border of another state another accusation said moscow overused the force majeure provision to change the coordinated plans of observation flights due to flights made by the country’s leaders in close proximity to the planned paths of observation flights but the provision was invoked only once why the us has chosen to keep russian surveillance aircraft away from

could unleash a chain reaction to bury the treaty as part of a broader process of arms control erosion for instance georgia has closed its skies to russian observation flights in a clear and gross violation of the ost it calls date flights into question the decision could be explained by the desire to conceal from observers the construction of military facilities the open skies treaty continues to be a valuable instrument for security and stability at the time of arms control crisis the ost enhances transparency and the risk of war with the treaty in force the us gains as much as russia but

individuals celebrating democratic freedom — the debate is closed isis is at war with the west and it must be ended of course in the days ahead some will argue that we should keep paris in perspective consider this weekend’s erudite assertions by the atlantic’s conor friedersdorf who cautions against french retaliation because illchosen wars can and do carry more costs than benefits this logic is grossly mistaken today as surely as at pearl harbor the choice of war has been imposed by the enemy from the relative sanctuary of its caliphate isis has now invaded the west with arrogant glee and although some will say that the terrorist threat remains small — that more people are killed by umbrellas than by terrorist attacks — this single attack of terrorism is an onslaught against our societal fabric by murdering a range of individuals in a range of social settings and in a range of ways isis is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure isis is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure however subtle the gross chilling effect born of this terrorism must not stand we must annihilate isis before it launches new attacks on our way of life and in france america

military forces against alqaeda syndicates in africa and challenging president obama to take a tougher stance against iran and syrian leader bashar alassad i expect hollande will show increasing fortitude in the days ahead after all with his proud people shocked but angered hollande will want to bring physical meaning to his statement that these attacks were acts of war and with the european union increasingly doubted over economic and sovereignty concerns see russia’s invasion of ukraine hollande will see this moment as a test of the eu’s resiliency both these considerations lead me to believe that france will significantly escalate its air campaign against isis and commence specialforces ground operations against isis leaders and infrastructure and in this response france deserves three forms of american support first president obama who was absent from the charlie hebdo memorial should visit paris in solidarity if possible he should address the french parliament and offer france us support in the form of escalated military retaliation second he should respond to this attack by energizing a more aggressive and comprehensive campaign against isis third president obama must draw greater attention to allied successes against isis this should include greater publicity including guncamera videos of actions like last week’s air strike on jihadi john isis leaders and fighters must come to perceive their banner as a magnet for purposeless death not ordained glory we must also challenge isis in other unconventional fields such as satire after all while islamic extremists hate being teased muslims attempting to reform political islam deserve our confidence in free speech crucially we must debate those in our own societies who push the warped delusion that

yawning’ — has been published in the academic journal current biology it is another stage in their research into the underlying biology of neuropsychiatric disorders and their search for new methods of treatment their latest findings show that our ability to resist yawning when someone else near us yawns is limited and our urge to yawn is increased if we are instructed to resist yawning but no matter how hard we try to stifle a yawn it might change how we yawn but it won’t alter our propensity to yawn importantly they have discovered that the urge to yawn — our propensity for contagious yawning — is individual to each one of us stephen jackson professor of cognitive neuroscience in the school of psychology led the multidisciplinary study he said we suggest that these findings may be particularly important in understanding further the association between motor excitability and the occurrence of echophenomena in a wide range of clinical conditions that have been linked to increased

cia analysts who work on russia refreshed their analysis about russian cyber meddling they earlier had considered that russia was attempting to undermine the us presidential election but after nov num they came to assume that russian interference was truly created to help trump win this latest finding fertilized an currently blazing public argument between the us intelligence agencies and the presidentelect over russian interference in the election i don’t believe it trump stated in an interview shown sunday on fox news discussing the idea that the russians desired to assist him i think it’s ridiculous trump and his aides deny not just the cia’s updated review about russian objectives but the early consensus reached by all num agencies and revealed in a rare joint public statement by director of national intelligence james clapper and dhs head jeh johnson that russia was meddling in the election in the first place the significance of the gulf can barely be overstated numerous foreign policy experts and lawmakers think russia’s behavior was an assault on the nation one ex  cia leader hillary clinton advocate michael morell compared russia’s invasion into us politics friday to the political equivalent of numnum the truth is the cia’s latest take is not the unanimous perspective of the intelligence community clapper who oversees all num us intelligence agencies had sufficient confidence to exchange the cia’s review to congress in a secret briefing last week but no similar review has leaked from any of the other num intelligence agencies the fbi for its portion determines that russia’s main goal was to stow mayhem and challenge american democracy a senior law enforcement official explained to nbc news aiding trump provided that objective the official stated but russia didn’t anticipate trump to win the election the cia’s review that the russians preferred trump was not determined by any single piece of new intelligence officials briefed on the matter explained to nbc news rather it was the outcome of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial proof more comprehensive than anything the public has observed human sources communications intercepts and other intelligence have permitted analysts to piece together the details of some of the players and the steps they took to harm clinton’s candidacy while boosting trump’s officials stated the cia also believed that while russian hackers collected information on republicans they did not release any of it the way they did with democratic emails leaked to wikileaks the republican national committee rejects its systems were hacked but the emails of individual republicans were collectedsomething nbc news documented in october the fbi is convinced the russians did not find anything volatile in the republican material they acquired the official stated despite the fact that it’s not apparent whether any us agency understands the full extent of what data russian hackers were capable to steal the cia also tracked a campaign of anticlinton news reports amplified by social media some of which came from russian state media outlets officials shared with nbc news the case that the russian campaign was clearly supposed to elect trump is not something the us could demonstrate in court officials point out which in part clarifies why fbi briefers have been more hesitant to embrace that situation in secret briefings to congress than have intelligence officials other intelligence agencies have not supported the cia perspective but no entity is acknowledged to oppose it nevertheless the question of motivewhy the russians purportedly meddled in the election  is completely independent from the more basic question of whether the us has strong proof that the russian government sponsored the concealed campaign on that score every intelligence agency in the government confirms the russians did it in october dni clapper and homeland security secretary jeh johnson released an extraordinary joint statement that the us intelligence community is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from us persons and institutions including from us political organizations one source acquainted with the intelligence stated it incorporated profiles of some of the suspects with photographs and could lead to inevitable indictments of specific russian actors if the justice department chooses to go after them the proof on that score basically doesn’t help trump’s recent commentary that it could be russia and it could be china and it could be some guy in his home in new jersey that is why the two trump proponents who lead the congressional intelligence committees sen richard burr of north carolina and rep devin nunes of california have each supplied statements in recent days conveying worry about russian hacking the senate select committee on intelligence has been and remains concerned about russia’s actions burr

aggressor and mcconnell made a point of saying he has the highest confidence in the intelligence community and especially the central intelligence agency on monday sen john mccain of arizona renewed his call for a bipartisan hearing but stated he didn’t think russians were attempting to engineer a trump victory that’s the reason we need a full investigation but i have seen no evidence of that it’s actual uncertain whether trump has been briefed on the same facts top republicans have observed because he has had only a handful of intelligence briefings since the election trump not only stated he didn’t believe the intelligence community’s review  he recommended that the cia was not to be believed in general providing a statement friday night observing that these are the same people that said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction several intelligence officials explained to nbc news they were seriously annoyed by that statement there is no historical precedent for a

boss and the agency he leads president barack obama doesn’t plan to make it effortless on trump he has requested that a dossier be assembled on the data about the russian covert operation a senior

campus free speech rating system institutions which hold a ‘yellow light speech code rating’ are defined as ones that have at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application the university of alabama has three policies that egregiously violate students’ first amendment rights those policies deal with university space event advertisement and event planning students can only use university space if an event is in accordance with the priorities of the designated area alabama also restricts where students can pass out advertisements for an approved event and the administration requires all advertisements to be in good taste the administration makes final rulings on what qualifies as good taste things like ground use restrictions really damage the ability of students to share ideas freely and openly zach warren president of the university of alabama’s young americans for liberty chapter told red alert politics on our campus any hand outs must be approved so when we hand out pocket constitutions those technically have to be submitted weeks in advance for approval these policies allow for administrative overreach and enable the administration to ignore students’ rights to free expression on campus another example of a yellow light policy is alabama’s event planning policy which requires students to submit an online event planning form seven to ten business days before an event an event that requires such steps include 5ks parades and demonstrations or marches in the university’s opinion these policies are designed to avoid scheduling conflicts and to allocate resources effectively taylor bryant university of alabama’s director of communications told red alert politics in an email that these policies supposedly help ensure the safety of our students and campus community and offers all campusaffiliated parties the same opportunities without disrupting the university’s ability to provide its essential services of teaching and learning our grounds use permit policy allows campus affiliates to request the space that meets their needs and helps university staff coordinate appropriate campus resources security grounds keeping etc and avoid scheduling conflicts bryant stated these policies have been abused by ua in the past as seen in octdate when ua imposed a num security fee on the ua college republicans chapter for bringing milo yiannopoulos to campus after initially expecting a fee of num ua continually increased the amount of the required security fee as the event drew near only after experiencing significant pushback from students did the university rescind the fee and allow the event to go on as planned while policies like those at university alabama are not unique what makes them especially egregious are the layers upon layers of red tape that the university puts on students to exercise their first amendment rights said alexander staudt director of free speech at young americans for liberty whether it is restricting spaceuse based on the priorities of that area or requiring a ‘good taste’ stamp of approval from administration for advertisements these policies are unconstitutional

panel republicans for presenting no new facts about the date terror attack aside from questioning num witnesses that had never before been interviewed by congressional investigators the select committee reviewed thousands of previously undisclosed documents and drew new conclusions about the administrations handling of the terror attack below are nine things the benghazi committee uncovered in its nummonth investigation email server hillary clintons use of a private email account and server was unknown to previous congressional committees that looked into the circumstances surrounding benghazi dozens of emails discussing the attack and libya were hidden on that server including some that shed light on how clinton and her aides initially sought to take \"ownership\" of the libyan invasion when news of clintons private email use first broke in mdate the benghazi committee seemingly entered a new highlypoliticized phase her server scandal took off just as she was preparing to enter the presidential race injecting partisan vitriol into an investigation that had proceeded in relative quiet up to that point the examination of clintons private emails led the committee to a previously unknown force that had helped shape the secretary of states policy in the runup to benghazi sidney blumenthal blumenthal behind the scenes a divisive political operative who was barred from working in the obama administration sidney blumenthal provided unvetted intelligence to clinton about libya even as he attempted to cultivate business opportunities in the wartorn country blumenthal appeared before the committee in date where his commercial dealings and potential conflicts of interest were questioned in a closeddoor interview at issue was the fact that a partisan figure had a direct line to the secretary of state on matters as sensitive as the regime change in libya in fact many of blumenthals missives to clinton have since been marked classified by the state department the extent of blumenthals influence was not uncovered in previous investigations of benghazi hillarys upcoming visit the select committee revealed clinton herself was set to visit libya weeks after the date attack a plan that was scrapped after the benghazi raid that scheduled trip was one of many instances that highlighted the state departments severe misreading of the security situation in libya clintons planned visit had implications for ambassador chris stevens who was laying the groundwork for her travel when he was killed in the attack gregory hicks deputy chief of mission in libya told committee investigators the ambassadors stay in benghazi was \"absolutely\" related to clintons visit permanent post stevens had journeyed to benghazi to work on a \"deliverable\" for clintons upcoming trip the select committee revealed his work on that deliverable involved preparing a proposal to turn the temporary diplomatic compound in benghazi into a permanent post \"we had begun the process of developing a political rationale for having a permanent post in benghazi\" hicks testified the report said state department discussions of benghazis deteriorating security situation earlier in num framed outbreaks of violence as \"anomalies\" as officials forged ahead with a plan to establish a diplomatic presence in the coastal libyan city given his nowfamous affection for the people of libya stevens was an advocate of the plan gadhafi rescuers the select committee discovered a group that \"most us government personnel did not even know existed\" helped the americans trapped at the cia annex escape on the morning of sept num \"this group ironically had close ties to the former gadhafi regime — the very regime the united states had helped remove from power\" the report said the report credited that group which was affiliated with deposed dictator muammar gadhafi with sparing \"dozens of lives\" according to the select committees findings a cia agent who had never previously been interviewed by other congressional investigators facilitated the evacuation with the gadhafi militias help the cia was \"reluctant\" to allow the committee to interview that agent the \"libyan military intelligence\" as the group was known arrived with a motorcade of num vehicles to transport the state department and cia personnel under siege at the annex to the airport where they could be evacuated to tripoli some of those vehicles were fitted with machine guns and others had secure fixtures that would allow the fleet to escape with the americans while taking fire the cia agent in question had contacted the libyan military intelligence for help after receiving a referral from a \"helpless\" contingent of local police officers who had been tapped to secure the annex but proved unable to do so the committee focused on the fact that for all of the state departments focus on cultivating relationships with the burgeoning libyan government the only people who tried to help the americans were those cast aside by the agency \"some of the very individuals the united states had helped remove from power during the libyan revolution were the only libyans that came to the assistance of the united states on the night of the benghazi attacks\" the report said uniform problems marines in rota spain who were awaiting orders to head for benghazi experienced hours of delay due to concern about what they were wearing one witness told the select committee after cnum planes reached the base and the marines who were part of a fleet antiterrorism security team known as a fast force prepared to take off for tripoli a threehour delay ensued due to deliberations about whether the company members should wear their military uniforms or civilian clothes and whether they would be permitted to carry weapons \"we were told multiple times to change what we were wearing\" the platoon commander testified \"there was also some talk of whether or not we could carry our personal weapons\" the commander testified that he advocated for his team to be allowed to carry weapons because they were headed into \"a very violent thing going on the ground\" in all the marines were forced to change their clothes four times before they were deployed to libya according to testimony gen carter ham thecommander of africom told the committee he did not learn of the uniform changes \"until after the fact\" and even then could not pinpoint a reason for the threehour delay in rota that delay had come after the c130s took six hours to arrive from germany despite receiving orders to fly there at once \"the fact that nearly twentyfour hours elapsed until those fast forces actually arrived in tripoli to reinforce the security there belies the expectations of the american people that the us military can and will move expeditiously\" the committee report said discussions over whether to force the fast marines to wear civilian clothes took place in washington where highlevel officials expressed concerns about a military show of force in libya \"they wanted to minimize the signature that looked like a big military invasion a big military arrival there\" one witness testified rather than increase the safety of the marines en route to benghazi \"the benefit of having the fast platoon wear civilian clothing was to cater to unexpressed libyan government concerns about military appearances\" the report said according to the report patrick kennedy the state departments undersecretary for management suggested the fast platoon shed their uniforms during a key white house meeting the night of the attack white house meeting around numnum pm washington time on the night of the raid highlevel officials gathered via secure video teleconference to discuss the events unfolding in benghazi neither president obama nor defense secretary leon panetta was present clinton attended as well as several of her top aides and kennedy the meeting was not convened until four hours after the attack began sean smith and stevens had already died \"despite the secretary of defenses expectation the assets he ordered to deploy would move as fast as possible in order to respond the individuals who participated in the white house meeting nevertheless felt the need to work through the assets the secretary had already ordered to deploy\" the report said republicans on the committee noted that meeting participants became \"surprisingly unable to recall details\" about what was discussed that night when they were questioned by investigators although an email sent by the pentagons chief of staff just before the conference indicated forces were \"spinning up\" and preparing to deploy the report indicated \"it was clear by the end of the white house meeting that no forces were going to benghazi\" diplomatic niceties administration officials placed tremendous importance on the way their actions would be perceived in libya during the attack the report found for example military assets in europe were not allowed to take off for benghazi until the administration received clearance from the libyan government to enter libyan airspace but the process was lengthy and required a libyan government official to receive paperwork for the request in person when no such official was on duty overnight as the attacks were unfolding before the raid even began diplomatic concerns prevented the state department from greenlighting a higher security profile for the ambassador in benghazi even though the conditions in the country warranted one no connection to cairo for weeks after the benghazi attack the administration attempted to link the violence in libya to a relatively peaceful protest in cairo hours earlier that had erupted over an inflammatory youtube clip internal correspondence obtained by the committee suggests that rather than receiving conflicting intelligence on the matter the administration knew within hours that the attack in benghazi had little to do with the demonstrations in cairo \"for press guidance if pressed whether we see a connection between these two we have no information regarding a connection between these incidents\" nuland wrote of the events in benghazi and cairo within two hours of the administration learning of the benghazi attack kennedy told congressional staff in a subsequent briefing that the benghazi attack had no relation to the cairo protest because the demonstrators in cairo had no weapons and simply spraypainted some illustrations near the cairo embassy', 'smart things you could say about ray rice and

quindell’s dodgy accounts datenum has been fined £700k + £90k costs by the financial reporting council frc this obscure body supposedly polices published accounts however it rarely seems to take action and when it does is very slow the audit partner responsible has also been reprimanded big deal and fined £56k  which is not a material sum of money to a partner in a decentsized accountancy firm also look at the timeline  it’s now num years from those incorrect accounts being created hardly a rapid response team as longer term readers here will remember i was consistently very bearish on quindell since its accounts were fairly obviously highly suspect excessive debtors excessive capitalisation into intangible assets and a flurry of acquisitions to muddy the waters are the usual giveaways of fake profits so these dodgy companies are really terribly easy to spot you can spot a highly abnormal balance sheet in just a few seconds so it really doesn’t take any particular forensic accounting skills to uncover dodgy companies with false profits you just have to have your wits about you the same was true with globo it was amazing how much venom from deluded fools in the investing community my bearish comments attracted over these num dodgy companies there was even an attempt to get me sacked from this role at stockopedia by quindellglobo shareholders cancelling their stockopedia subscriptions of course ed put editorial integrity before short term revenues backing me to the hilt that i was proven correct by subsequent events was very satisfying anyway the perpetrators of the quindell and globo frauds are still at large with their illgotten gains having relieved gullible uk investors of hundreds of millions of pounds as i sadly commented to an investor friend at the weekend white collar crime in the uk very much does pay the action taken by the frc reported today is too little too late in my view to properly punish or deter the same sort of thing happening again kudos by the way to tom winnifrith for his tireless obsessive exposure of multiple wrongdoings at both quindell and globo people may not like his style but he’s done outstanding work exposing many dodgy companies having worked in audit myself at the start of my career in the edates i can confirm that it’s really very easy to pull the wool over the eyes of auditors their checks on the numbers are not very detailed and a clever fd can cover up all sorts of problems so the onus is very much on investors to do our own reasonablenesschecking on published accounts if the numbers don’t look right then it’s best to steer clear a popular misconception is that auditors are highly paid they’re actually not audits are often tendered at low prices in order to get a foot in the door to enable more lucrative tax and acquisitionrelated work to be secured there seems to be an invisible force pulling the american markets relentlessly higher with no significant pullback in a long time this is very worrying some are describing it as a melt up this is not normal or healthy market behaviour in my view could we be heading for a crash i don’t know markets are meant to climb a wall of worry with regular corrections this seemingly unstoppable move upwards could be the precursor to a violent correction possibly successful trader mark minervini recently tweeted that the only times he can remember the american market being this exuberant were just before date crash and just before the dotcom bubble bursting in num however this big rise could be justified maybe us shares are rerating because the big corporate tax cuts in the us will increase earnings considerably that in turn could trigger an economic boom of increased investment amp a virtuous circle of higher growth greater consumer spending etc who knows that’s what happened under president reagan after all  he initially stimulated the us economy with big tax cuts which ushered in a period of great economic success these things are impossible to predict and nearly all forecasters get it so wrong that you would have expected them to pack in forecasting as a bad job yet strangely people especially the media still treat their forecasts with quite unjustified reverence economics is still very much in its infancy and has barely scratched the surface in terms of being able to accurately predict what the economy will do in practice so i think it’s best to accept that we haven’t got a clue what the future holds despite this i’m increasingly nervous about this market meltup so have opened some short positions on the us markets that’s proving expensive so far but i don’t mind losses on hedges they’re an insurance policy and insurance costs money as regards the uk markets i’m seeing a lot of nervousness in small to mid caps at the moment it feels like the days of everything going up day after day are now over we’ve been spoiled by very buoyant market conditions for a long time now there are many former momentum stars which have sold off considerably in the last few months eg boohoocom lonboo i’m long and iqe loniqe  investors seem to be ignoring many satisfactory or even good updates and banking profits instead there certainly seems a lack of investor appetite to take small caps to new highs at the moment that’s probably quite sensible actually as lots of small caps are now very pricey and the uk economy seems to be in a soft patch so there seem to be lots of profit warnings being issued mind you bargains can be found in illiquid markets when some investors start throwing out the baby with the bath water andor see their stop losses triggered for no particular underlying reason i favour such market conditions as from time to time the market throws a bargain in my direction as people sometimes act irrationally  scared out of good shares by erratic spikes down in price anyway let’s have a look at some small cap announcements today by the way i apologise for any typos today  am using a small laptop with a screen that i’m struggling to see properly lonelco share price num5p up num today no shares num4m market cap £num2m at the time of writing i hold a long position in this share trading statement elecosoft plc aim elco the aimlisted construction software specialist… clever wording makes it sounds better than it is this is an in line update … is pleased to announce that revenue and profit before tax trading for the year ended num decedate are both expected to be significantly higher compared with revenue and profit before tax for the year ended num decedate and in line with market expectations cash generation sounds good elecosoft’s strong conversion of operating profits into cash in the year enabled the group to eliminate its net borrowing position at num date and to also improve its net cash position further as at num decedate i love it when companies eliminate their debt through cash generation other points high customer renewal rates a good sign  the product must be good emphasis on good training amp support for customers again a good thing successful acquisition has been integrated favourable forex movements outlook  nothing specific just says look forward with confidence my opinion  i picked up a few of these shares a while back on a positive update generally i’m not keen on software companies as they’re quite prone to profit warnings  often being heavily reliant on lumpy licence sales this share looks priced about right in my view it’s good to have a reassuring update today under its belt stockopedia remains to be convinced with a neutral style and a middling stockrank of num let’s hope those improve if financial performance continues to be good lonlpa share price num5p up num today at numnum no shares num38m market cap £num4m at the time of writing i have a long position in this share final results  for the year ended num date lpa group plc lpa is a designer manufacturer and supplier of light emitting diode ledbased lighting and electromechanical systems it announces today …record results for the year ended num septedate and a strong start to the new financial year this company put out a positivesounding trading update which i covered here on num date as often happens the surge in share price on the day responding to a positive update amp outlook continued with the share price rising about another num today i won’t spend long on this company as it’s too small amp illiquid  i was only able to pick up a few shares it might be of interest to readers with small portfolios who don’t have a problem with illiquid positions key points revenues up num to £num5m preexceptional operating profit up num to £num9m exceptionals are negligible so nothing to worry about there basic eps up num to num4p  giving a per of num dividends are modest but growing  up from num5p last year to num7p this year  a yield of num order intake amp closing order book both up nicely so the outlook amp visibility are positive recent trading  q1 significantly ahead of prior year balance sheet  looks fine to me with a sound working capital position there’s a little debt but i don’t see that as a problem note there is a pension fund which is in surplus on an accounting level but may be in deficit on an actuarial basis it’s not significant as the cashflow statement shows £100k pa payments by the company into the fund capex looks high but the narrative mentions relocating its factory which is likely to have caused a spike in capex my opinion  based on a quick review only i quite like the figures amp outlook here so for micro cap investors happy to accept poor market liquidity this might be worth a closer look it seems soundly financed performing well and has a strong order book plus it pays modest divis i think it would be worthwhile to do some more digging to understand what products it makes the crucial consideration is whether demand is likely to continue or whether the company is riding on the crest of a wave from oneoff orders overall though it’s worth a closer look i think note that the stockopedia data from thomson reuters shows only num5p eps expectation date so the actual of eps of num4p is a long way ahead of that therefore we can probably anticipate an improving stockrank once the actual numbers flow through so i’ll wager that this middling stockrank could start to improve soon lonboku share price 85p unchanged today no shares num5m market cap £num5m trading update boku aim boku the world’s leading independent direct carrier billing company is pleased to provide the following unaudited trading update for the year ended num decedate this is the company’s first trading update since admission to aim in novedate my understanding is that this company’s software enables people to buy things on their mobile phones apps games etc without the need for a credit card the cost is instead routed to their mobile phone bill or prepaid account this is useful in countries where credit cards are not widely used num revenues exceed 24m  up num on num  and an adjusted ebitda positive second half as we know adjusted ebitda can hide a multitude of sins  especially at software companies where large amounts of overheads can be capitalised thus flattering ebitda this is impressive total processed value tpv of num7bn date was more than triple date amount of num million thanks to continued growth across all customer segments  most notably app stores and digital music subscriptions amp bundling although if a tripling of total processed value only results in a num rise in revenues doesn’t that suggest individual transactions are being done a lot more cheaply looking on the stockreport my first port of call for any new company is the historical graphs these have already scared me off my opinion  it’s clearly a jam tomorrow situation the £num5m market cap clearly includes some heroic assumptions about future growth i don’t tend to buy into things like that unless i really understand the sector amp the business which is not the case here so i think this one is really just for punters and people who properly understand the business and think it’s likely to deliver the massive growth necessary for the current market cap let alone a higher one this reminds me of bango lonbgo which looks similar and is also relying on exponential growth to justify its extremely high relative to historic losses valuation so these num shares could be multibaggers if the growth gains momentum or they could crash disastrously if growth disappoints and heavy losses continue  requiring further fundraises in future high risk potentially high reward they’re not for me  why take the risk loneye share price 224p down num today at numnum no shares num4m market cap £num9m trading update eagle eye the saas technology company that allows businesses to create a realtime connection with their customers here’s our archive of my num previous reports on this company you can find this list of articles on any company just by putting in the ticker then clicking on the discuss tab at the top of the stockreport i don’t like the company’s new description of what it does as it doesn’t actually explain what the company does its previous description from a date announcement was much more clear saas technology company that validates and redeems digital promotions in realtime for the grocery retail and hospitality industries why change something clear to something opaque a very odd thing to do clarity and simplicity are always best it reports today on progress for h1 of numnum being the num months to num date so it has a num date year end here are the highlights as presented by the company and yellow highlighting from me there is strong growth in various kpis there but revenue is only up num  not madly exciting i tend to prefer revenue growth of num+ at growth companies  because you don’t need to grow at that rate compounded for long before the figures get exciting cash  the other thing that jumps out at me from this list is that the company seems to have burned through most of its cash looking back through previous rnss the company raised £6m before expenses or £num8m after expenses in date so i’m rather surprised it’s only got £num8m left maybe there was some debt that was repaid as part of the previous fundraise ah yes i’ve spotted a £3m facility with barclays in the last full year accounts which looks as if it’s currently undrawn i’m not keen on lossmaking companies using bank borrowings clearly the company will need to do another placing fairly soon as it’s still cash hungry a lot of development costs are being capitalised this is not necessarily a problem as the company seems wellsupported by investors with a generous market cap for a lossmaking company so raising say another £5m would only result in c10 dilution  unhelpful but not a disaster outlook  there’s lots of commentary in today’s update about customer wins etc the conclusion is … confidence of delivering its expectations for the financial year ending num date my opinion  there’s definitely something interesting here in my view this company clearly has an interesting innovative product with big name customers however for me the financial progress has to date been somewhat limited it’s still quite heavily lossmaking looking at the broker forecasts there are big expectations for revenue growth rising to £num8m in numnum and £num8m in numnum yet these big increases in revenues would only just tip it into normalised profit before tax of just £num9m in numnum i’m struggling to see how that justifies a £num9m market cap now this share would therefore only interest me if i could be convinced that the company is set to smash those forecasts and deliver much higher growth and future profitability as things stand though i think it looks an interesting company with a promisingsounding product but the financials don’t look very good yet and the price looks a bit toppy plus it will need to raise more equity fairly soon so i’d rather hold fire and reassess it once it’s properly funded i’d say a placing of £10m+ is really necessary rather than doing repeat smaller fundraisings the danger of that is that the fundraising window can easily slam shut in a future bear market leaving the company potentially high amp dry the stockopedia computers only award eye a low stockrank of num  which is understandable as early stage lossmaking companies nearly always fail to excite either the stockopedia algorithms or me anyway i wish the company well and look forward to reviewing it again when the next set of numbers come out as usual i reserve the right to change my mind at any time if growth accelerates and makes it a more exciting investment proposition lonflo share price num25p down num today no shares num8m market cap £num6m trading update london tuesday num jandate aim listed specialist technical fluid power products supplierflowtech fluidpower plc lse symbol flo is pleased to announce the following unaudited update on its performance for the year ended num decedate and to the period up to this announcement… the update starts with an in line with expectations comment and positive noises about further expansion pbt in line with expectations whilst the group’s heightened profile and enhanced technical skills capabilities created in both the uk and europe has ensured that opportunities for further significant expansion have continued to be presented revenues up num to £num9m scanning through the rns the group seems to have made several acquisitions in num which has obviously pushed up revenues organic growth is good at num net debt has risen num to £num7m note that there has also been some dilution this year from an equity fundraising this is an excellent update with lots of useful information divisional gross margins remain broadly in line with the prior year as a result of a weightier mix towards the generally lower margin pmc operations a slight reduction in overall margin  is projected therefore the board expects underlying profit before tax for the year ended num decedate will be in the range num6m to num8m which is in line with market expectations i’m impressed that the group can give a fairly tight range of likely profit num days after the year end this suggests to me that it has a competent finance department with good internal controls six acquisitions were made during the year which strikes me as perhaps being a bit too ambitious there’s a risk that this might have stretched management bandwidth a little thin a refurbishedredesigned shared logistics centre has also been completed with no disruption to customer service this management team really have been busy impressive stuff dividends will rise num giving a yield of num  not bad valuation  this looks reasonably priced on the cheap side even when you adjust for net debt the stockrank is very high and it is also classified as a super stock my opinion  i like it this is a stock we’ve looked at here before and felt positive about it strikes me as a good quality buy amp build which appears to be managed very well i like the decent operating profit margin  which comes from holding a wide range of niche spare parts for various machinery and high levels of customer service eg rapid delivery options which is vital when the clients’ important machines are idle waiting on a spare part from flo this share looks to me as if it could continue to be a steady riser as more acquisitions are bolted on so a thumbs up from me here’s the flo chart geddit  if we’d bought that dip in date we’d be num up plus divis by now that’s something to think about work in progress stockopedia source

social media mistakes one of those mistakes is annoying auto direct messages you may receive one of these when you engage with someone’s account by following them or liking a tweet of theirs immediately after you click follow a program automatically sends you a prewritten message i’m not entirely against the idea of auto dm services but it’s gotten completely out of hand and is mostly used irresponsibly the end result is an inbox saturated with pointless messages forcing your authentic oneonone interactions to the bottom here are the worst seven messages i’ve received hola gracias por seguirme me dejas saber si hay algo en que lo puedo ayudar a innovar if you’re going to send anyone a message make sure it’s in the person’s native speaking language even when translated the message is the standard thanks let me know if i can help i’m not sure how many people are asking for help from strangers on twitter sending a pm suspicious looking domain that was it just a typo domain in the message screaming click through at your own risk thnx num following me be the ceo of you supply another generic message i’m not sure what action you want me to take with a statement like

of my recent follower please rt if you like my thoughts linkedin removed and like my facebook page  there are more than a few things wrong with this dm this person’s first mistake is starting with a version of thank you you’re only adding insult to injury by thanking someone through an automatic message it’s a waste of space and we end up with num of them in our inbox just saying thanks  at least we’re heading in some semblance of the correct direction with this one they’re giving us a legitimate action to take and asking to retweet them your fans will retweet you if they want to not because you asked using poor grammar  it doesn’t make sense to randomly insert their linkedin profile and the demand to like their facebook page apparently following them on twitter just wasn’t enough if you’re using automatic messages as a sales funnel don’t just direct someone to another social platform unless you’ve heavily monetized it send them to sign up for your newsletter or give them a discount and push them to your web store instead listen to the removed song on my sound cloud channel this one speaks for itself while it might be advantageous for them to get more traffic to their song and channel for whatever reason they failed to insert the entire name and author of the song what their channel is or even a link if you’re going to request an action from a stranger in a dm don’t make them do any research hi edward zeiden thank you for following what are your hobbies or interests this message makes me think i accidentally signed up for a dating website when you open your eyes to the magic of who you are even in the blackness of night…it goes on like this for num more lines this is definitely one of the more unique ones but still unwarranted long and without a point if you’re going to use an auto dm service make sure your message is proofed for grammar and spelling gives something back to the receiver as a true token of gratitude and present a clear and concise action to take here’s a decent example i found get num off your next order at removed with code tweet10 at website i’m not thrilled with receiving an ad i didn’t sign up for but it’s a step in the right direction if they also sent me a medium link to an educational article they wrote that aligned with my interests that would soften the blow remember that when you use an auto dm service it’s usually to increase engagement on twitter push users to your website to read your blog take a survey or buy something if you’re not doing one of these and in a quick and professional manner it’s best

quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected centerright government in macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist george soros records obtained by judicial watch show barack obama’s us ambassador to macedonia jess l baily has worked behind the scenes with soros’ open society foundation to funnel large sums of american dollars for the cause constituting an interference of the us ambassador in domestic political affairs in violation of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations the cash flows through the state department and the famously corrupt us agency of international development usaid which is charged with providing global economic development and humanitarian assistance usaid has allocated about num million to leftwing soros groups in macedonia sdate documents show and at least num million has been earmarked by the agency to intervene in the balkan nation’s governmental affairs datenum state department figures have been tougher to come by and judicial watch has filed a freedom of information act foia request for the numbers judicial watch also fired off a public records request to usaid because the preliminary figures obtained through various sources in both the us and macedonia appear to be incomplete here’s how the clandestine operation functions according to highlevel sources in macedonia and the us that have provided judicial watch with records as part of an ongoing investigation the open society foundation has established and funded dozens of leftwing nongovernmental organizations ngos in macedonia to overthrow the conservative government one macedonian government official interviewed by judicial watch in washington dc recently calls it the soros infantry the groups organize youth movements create influential media outlets and organize violent protests to undermine the institutions and policies implemented by the government one of the soros’ groups funded the translation and publication of saul alinsky’s rules for radicals into macedonian the book is a tactical manual of subversion provides direct advice for radical street protests and proclaims lucifer to be the first radical thanks to obama’s ambassador who has not been replaced by president trump uncle sam keeps the money flowing so the groups can continue operating and recruiting sources in macedonia and the us confirm with a

at the peak of the european migration crisis a macedonian official told judicial watch and the impact was devastating this is likely of big interest to soros a renowned open borders advocate who pushes international governance diminished us global power and an increase in muslim immigration soros spent tens of millions of dollars to support hillary clinton’s presidential campaign just this month hungary’s prime minister lashed out against soros for funding groups to secretly influence the country’s politics largebodied predators are swimming here in the waters said viktor orban in his annual state of the nation speech this is the transborder empire of george soros with tons of money and international heavy artillery this appears to be the case in macedonia with the help of american financing there have been a number of violent protests in recent months that have been coordinated by soros’ open society foundation through its usfunded ngos sources tell judicial watch some us members of congress have expressed interest in the issue and have demanded answers from ambassador baily usaid and the state department in typical fashion the state department has stonewalled the inquiries and usaid hasn’t been much more forthcoming last month utah senator mike lee sent ambassador baily a letter asking questions involving the us mission to macedonia’s involvement in the political process and its connections to the open society foundation it’s unlikely that americans will receive answers especially since baily is probably on his way out the fact remains however that

humanity has fallen ill with the ascension of donald trump onto the highest throne of political power on planet earth some of us might feel that the sickness is finally going to be called out illumined and healed while others feel that trump and his administration are themselves the current purveyors lineage holders and embodiments of the sickness either way the fact that humanity is not well — afflicted with some sort of disorder — is something that i think we can all agree upon this might be a good starting point for our inquiry the obvious question what is the nature of this deeper sickness that is pulsing through the veins of humanity in contemplating this very question philosopher john mcmurtry author of the brilliant book the cancer stage of capitalism refers to the great sickness that pervades our modern day capitalist system as having all of the hallmark qualities of cancer using a whole systems approach he points out that the diagnosis of cancer precisely maps onto a macroanalysis of our current body politic which is to say that what is happening collectively in our world can be recognized to be a form of cancer continue reading also by paul levy', 'the son of

copblock and posted at various other alternative media outlets these are great tips for anyone but most certainly for a copblocker tye may do additional features that are more detailed in the future so if you have questions concerns or suggestions please comment below the first thing i notice about many activists and protesters is their total lack of digital security most of us carry around a computer in our pocket that allows us to do amazing things from recording high definition videos and taking photos to accessing the most amazing collection of data the human race has ever amassed yet despite the capabilities of this amazing device few actually understand what this device is capable of this will be a basic guide written for the average user and as such it will gloss over many things and drastically oversimplify the technical aspects of many others for the sake of simplicity every time that you use a computer of any kind certain security precautions must be taken in order to ensure your personal safety from both those who would steal your data and the state which may wish to either claim that you have violated one or more of their illegitimate rules or else simply frame you for such basic security measures are inexpensive often free and easy enough for even those less technical users click banner above to connect with a copblock group near you the first recommendation is always to fully encrypt your device as the recent fbi vs apple court case showed even this simple step is enough to put a thorn in the side of a huge state agency with practically limitless resources encryption is a way to make the data useless without the correct passphrase while recent iphones anything after the iphone 3gs are encrypted by default android devices are not however this is a very simple process and stepbystep guides for every device available are easily accessed through a simple online search most devices running a recent version of the android operating system can be encrypted by going to settings > more tab > security make sure your phone is fully charged before attempting this as it may take a while if given the option always choose to fully encrypt any external memory you have in your phone many people love the option of using a fingerprint to decrypt their phone and consider it to be highly secure however please take into account the courts have ruled that you have a right against selfincrimination that is enumerated under the fifth amendment against giving up your passphrase in order to decrypt your phone while you have no right against giving up your finger print if arrested for any activism it is highly likely that your mobile device will be seized and unless you wish the actors of the state to have access to everything on it think of photos and videos of persons committing civil disobedience personal photos or data access to your social media etc then this is something you may wish to take into account also it is impossible for state agents to plant suicide notes or evidence on something they cannot access just having a passcode on your phone does not mean it cannot be accessed it must be encrypted  multiauthor adsense  skipped due to there being num adsense ads on this page already  copblock information tips tactics gear graphics and more click graphic further security precautions would include turning off wifi and bluetooth when you are not actively using them these features provide others with a way to access your phone that you do not wantthe second recommendation is for a good antivirus program you may call this a cell phone but it is not it is a mobile computer with phone capabilities if you cannot afford a paid program then there are some that are available for free of which i recommend bitdefender however i personally only use kaspersky internet security for my android i have found it to be among the best available with a feature set that is particularly useful for those involved in activism including the ability to remotely lock the phone and even remotely wipe the phone of data here i must make a legal disclaimer in all jurisdictions i am aware of it is illegal to tamper with evidence and wiping data from a phone could be taken as such if the state agents wish to make a case against you so use such features at your own discretion personally i like having this option available remember that not all people who would seek to exploit your information are employees of the state for those who wish to use the internet anonymously from their mobile device and prevent others from being able to electronically gather their passphrases used over the internet when browsing over an unsecure wifi hotspot then a virtual private networkvpn is a must have paid vpn services are cheap fast and easy to use arguably the best available is private internet access it can be bought anonymously over the internet and downloaded to a total of five devices this service provides a secure connection from your device be it a mobile device or home personal computer to one of over thirty of their servers worldwide your data cannot be read until it reaches their end server and is decrypted there this not only prevents people from being able to intercept your data over wifi but can also be used to mask your true location the encryption protocols offered by the company private internet access are the best available and considered as of yet to be unbreakable the free options available are much more difficult for a beginner and tend to have far more restricted

exceed trump blockchain stocks are next a redneck’s guide to reversing their control of your brain no matter how historically incorrect so many people jews and nonjews cannot help but use their brainwashed minds to play the hitler card case in point is stephen lendman’s recent post about israeli viciousness israel treats palestinians the way hitler persecuted jews every day is kristallnacht for longsuffering people under apartheid conditions worse than south africa’s this is not to say that he is incorrect about israeli viciousness because they are apparently vicious murdering monsters this is not to argue his defense of palestinians because i agree but for smart people much like sweetie zuesse to continually use the standard erroneous brainwashing to bolster a point in direct opposition to historical fact makes them opportunists at best and liars at worst i don’t think there is another subject so erroneously engrained within the psyche of the world as this devious jewish one of using hitler the nsdap and germany in general to bolster sympathy for jewsisrael and to cover for their carnage against the world i have shown sweetie to be a liar several times but lendman i believe is just mistaken and found that using the meme will fortify his point lendman could have used another example based upon truth let’s be accurate shall we too bad lendman still uses the hitler card even when attacking israel and towards jews to a small degree but the truth is that hitler was disgusted with those two nights and had nothing to do with their instigation or implementation it was a stain to his party and totally against his direction and desires what really happened during the crystal night now let us look at what really happened during that fateful night adate any harm ever done to any jew in national socialist germany has been described in great detail in many publications and combined with otherstories to give exaggerated figures which have then become the socalled historical truth how strange it is then that despite the passage of more than forty years no one has established the true extent of the damage done to the jews during the crystal night all one can learn from history writers is that all synagogues were demolished and that all shop windows were destroyed aside from this vague description one is given almost no details on the basis of the socalled historical truth about the crystal night the president of the world jewish congress nahum goldmann had the chutzpah in num to claim num million dollars from german chancellor konrad adenauer as reparation payment for the damage done during that november night when adenauer asked goldmann for his justification for this enormous request goldmann replied you find the justification yourself what i want is not the justification but the money note num and he got his money goldmann may have interpreted the willingness of the german chancellor to pay a half billion dollars as proof for the claim that all synagogues had been destroyed why else would germany be so foolish as to pay for something which never happened all the same the historical truth that all german synagogues were destroyed is a lie in num there were approximately num synagogues in germany of which only about num were destroyed or damaged furthermore jews owned approximately num shops and department stores in germany in num of this number only about num had their windows broken these figures show just how much the socalled historical truth differs from what actually happened the damage and destruction that did actually occur was of course a terrible shame but the exaggerations especially by german historians who use them to condemn their own people are also a shame history writers tell us that during the crystal night all the jews were frightened meekly accepted whatever happened to them and watched the destruction of their property with no resistance the contrary is true while going through the files on this subject i found many documents which report precisely just the opposite of what is claimed the fact is that in many cases jews and their german neighbors fought together against the attackers pushing them down staircases street mobs were beaten up and chased away in more than one case police and party officials were generally on the side of the jews some jewish community leaders went to police stations the next morning and asked the police to investigate the damage done to their synagogues the resulting police reports are still available in the files today also contrary to what we have been told most jews were not directly affected by these events in berlin for example all of the teachers and pupils of the city’s largest jewish school which served the entire berlin area appeared in their classes the next morning without having noticed anything unusual during the previous night heinemann stern the jewish principal of that school wrote in his postwar memoirs that he noticed a burning synagogue on his way to the school on the morning after the crystal night but he thought it was just an accidental fire it was only after he arrived at the school that he received a telephone call informing him of the destruction of the previous night he then went on with his classes of the day and only during the first recess did he take the trouble to inform the entire student body about what had happened note num how can such evidence be reconciled with the claim by herman graml a prominent german historian and associate of the munich institute of contemporary history who wrote every single jew was beaten chased robbed insulted and humiliated the sa tore the jews from their beds mercilessly beat them in their apartments and then … chased them almost to death … blood flowed everywhere note num is it conceivable that thousands of jewish children would be have been sent to school by their parents on the morning after that fateful night if the attacks against jews had been so horrific or extensive would any parents have let their children go to school if they had thought there was even the slightest danger of them being attacked by roving gangs of sa men i think the answer is clearly no deplorable things did indeed happen which were bad enough but the fantasies of modern historians and history writers such as graml are simply inexcusable really isn’t it silly to compare a num day event immediately shunned by the very one lendman and everyone else blames to a halfcentury long apartheid something tells me that there is a group that trumps the adolf

be contained by the two main political parties the democratic and republican parties have become little more than squalid clubs of privilege and wealth whores to money and corporate interests hostage to a massive arms industry and so adept at deception and selfdelusion they no longer know truth from lies we will either find our way out of this mess by embracing an uncompromising democratic socialism—one that will insist on massive government relief and work programs the nationalization of electricity and gas companies a universal notforprofit government health care program the outlawing of hedge funds a radical reduction of our bloated military budget and an end to imperial wars—or we will continue to be fleeced and impoverished by our bankrupt elite and shackled and chained by our surveillance state the free market and globalization promised as the route to worldwide prosperity have been exposed as a con game but this does not mean our corporate masters will disappear totalitarianism as george orwell pointed out is not so much an age of faith as an age of schizophrenia a society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial orwell wrote that is when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud force and fraud are all they have left they will use both there is a political shift in europe toward an open confrontation with the corporate state germany has seen a surge of support for die linke the left a political grouping formed num months ago it is coled by the veteran socialist red oskar lafontaine who has built his career on attacking big business twothirds of germans in public opinion polls say they agree with all or some of die linke’s platform the socialist party of the netherlands is on the verge of overtaking the labor party as the main opposition party on the left greece beset with street protests and violence by disaffected youths has seen the rapid rise of the coalition of the radical left in spain and norway socialists are in power resurgence is not universal especially in france and britain but the shifts toward socialism are significant corporations have intruded into every facet of life we eat corporate food we buy corporate clothes we drive corporate cars we buy our vehicular fuel and our heating oil from corporations we borrow from corporate banks we invest our retirement savings with corporations we are entertained informed and branded by corporations we work for corporations the creation of a mercenary army the privatization of public utilities and our disgusting forprofit health care system are all legacies of the corporate state these corporations have no loyalty to america or the american worker they are not tied to nation states they are vampires by now the commercial revolution has deprived the mass of consumers of any independent access to the staples of life clothing shelter food even water wendell berry wrote in the unsettling of america air remains the only necessity that the average user can still get for himself and the revolution had imposed a heavy tax on that by way of pollution commercial conquest is far more thorough and final than military defeat the corporation is designed to make money without regard to human life the social good or impact on the environment corporate laws impose a legal duty on corporate executives to make as much money as possible for shareholders although many have moved on to fleece shareholders as well in date documentary film the corporation the management guru peter drucker says if you find an executive who wants to take on social responsibilities fire him fast a corporation that attempts to engage in social responsibility that tries to pay workers a decent wage with benefits that invests its profits to protect the environment and limit pollution that gives consumers fair deals can be sued by shareholders robert monks the investment manager says in the film the corporation is an externalizing machine in the same way that a shark is a killing machine there isn’t any question of malevolence or of will the enterprise has within it and the shark has within it those characteristics that enable it to do that for which it was designed ray anderson the ceo of interface corp the world’s largest commercial carpet manufacturer calls the corporation a present day instrument of destruction because of its compulsion to externalize any cost that an unwary or uncaring public will allow it to externalize the notion that we can take and take and take and take waste and waste without consequences is driving the biosphere to destruction anderson says in short the film based on joel bakan’s book the corporation the pathological pursuit of profit and power asserts that the corporation exhibits many of the traits found in people clinically defined as psychopaths psychologist dr robert hare lists in the film psychopathic traits and ties them to the behavior of corporations callous unconcern for the feelings for others incapacity to maintain enduring relationships reckless disregard for the safety of others deceitfulness repeated lying and conning others for profit incapacity to experience guilt failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior and yet under the american legal system corporations have the same legal rights as individuals they give hundreds of millions of dollars to political candidates fund the army of some num lobbyists in washington and thousands more in state capitals to write corporatefriendly legislation drain taxpayer funds and abolish government oversight they saturate the airwaves the internet newsprint and magazines with advertisements promoting their brands as the friendly face of the corporation they have highpriced legal teams millions of employees skilled public relations firms and thousands of elected officials to ward off public intrusions into their affairs or halt messy lawsuits they hold a near monopoly on all electronic and printed sources of information a few media giants—aoltime warner general electric viacom disney and rupert murdoch’s newsgroup—control nearly everything we read see and hear private capital tends to become concentrated in a few hands partly because of competition among the capitalists and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones albert einstein wrote in num in the monthly review in explaining why he was a socialist the result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society this is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who for all practical purposes separate the electorate from the legislature the consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population moreover under existing conditions private capitalists inevitably control directly or indirectly the main sources of information press radio education it is thus extremely difficult and indeed in most cases quite impossible for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights labor and leftwing activists especially university students and wellheeled liberals have failed to unite this division which is often based on social rather than economic differences has long stymied concerted action against ruling elites it has fractured the american left and rendered it impotent large sections of the middle class are being gradually proletarianized but the important point is that they do not at any rate not in the first generation adopt a proletarian outlook orwell wrote in num during the last economic depression here i am for instance with a bourgeois upbringing and a workingclass income which class do i belong to economically i belong to the working class but it is almost impossible for me to think of myself as anything but a member of the bourgeoisie and supposing i had to take sides whom should i side with the upper class which is trying to squeeze me out of existence or the working class whose manners are not my manners it is probable that i personally in any important issue would side with the working class but what about the tens or hundreds of thousands of others who are in approximately the same position and what about that far larger class running into millions this time—the officeworkers and blackcoated employees of all kinds—whose traditions are less definite middle class but who would certainly not thank you if you called them proletarians all of these people have the same interests and the same enemies as the working class all are being robbed and bullied by the same system yet how many of them realize it when the pinch came nearly all of them would side with their oppressors and against those who ought to be their allies it is quite easy to imagine a working class crushed down to the worst depths of poverty and still remaining bitterly antiworkingclass in sentiment this being of course a readymade fascist party coalitions of environmental antinuclear anticapitalist sustainableagriculture and antiglobalization forces have coalesced in europe to form and support socialist parties this has yet to happen in the united states the left never rallied in significant numbers behind cynthia mckinney or ralph nader in picking the lesser of two evils it threw its lot in with a democratic party that backs our imperial wars empowers the national security state and does the bidding of corporations if barack obama does not end the flagrant theft of taxpayer funds by corporate slugs and the disgraceful abandonment of our working class especially as foreclosures and unemployment mount many in the country will turn in desperation to the far right embodied by groups such as christian radicals the failure by the left to offer a democratic socialist alternative will mean there will be in the eyes of many embittered and struggling working and middleclass americans no alternative but a perverted christian fascism the inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake it will ensure if this does not soon change a ruthless totalitarian

by mni news  the european central bank initially received praise for its decision to push the deposit rate below zero as part of its truly unconventional monetary policy the euro plunged equities recovered and euro area manufacturing outperformed its global peers holders of longterm benchmark bonds have been handsomely rewarded by the ecb’s monetary policy experiment as numyear yields in germany have resumed their violent decline and investors expect more judged by the decline in shortterm yields indicating a further interestrate cut in march of at least num percentage point but equity investors in the banking sector have been voting with their feet this is partly due to fears over new rules allowing regulators to bail in creditors and equity holders but it is also because of angst that already beleaguered eurozone financial institutions will suffer further slings and arrows from disappearing net interestrate margins adding insult to injury currency markets have also challenged central banks’ use of negative interest rates global growth fears have led to the unwinding of euro and yenfunded carry trades pushing up the value of the two currencies the bank of japan’s attempt to curb investor interest in its currency by lowering its deposit rate below zero has so far been no match for the upward pressure on the yen risk sentiment eventually will recover and so will traders’ inclination to use the euro and yen as funding currencies but it is difficult to deny that one of the cornerstones of postnum monetary policy tools has suffered a severe blow a large central bank like the ecb can enjoy a firstmover advantage by being the first to push interest rates below zero but as other major central banks follow diminishing returns set in and the disadvantages could begin to outweigh the advantages the potential downsides from negative interest rates are hotly contested but we can point to at least two clear examples in the euro area banks’ return on equity and net margins have recovered somewhat following the sovereign debt crisis in num but downside risks are looming based on the persistent decline in interest rates based on the historical relationship between return on equity and longterm bond yields investors currently face negative returns on eurozone bank equities the money market industry is another victim of low interest rates assets under management in money market funds have been resilient despite low interest rates this is likely a result of qe surging ecb demand for government securities means that the tax from negative interest rates has been lower in money market funds than in government bonds but these funds’ business model doesn’t make sense at negative interest rates we estimate that the most of the eligible assets for the eurozone’s money market funds trade with yields below zero customers will be willing to pay for access to liquidity but only to an extent and money market funds won’t survive this interest rate regime for ever a more fundamental critique levied at negative interest is that the policy leads to behavior opposite of what central banks want the portfolio rebalancing theory suggests that lowering benchmark yield via quantitative easing qe and zero interest rate policy zirp pushes investors to move funds further out the risk spectrum the idea is to encourage money managers and wealth holders to lend their capital to riskier but also more productive projects we have certainly seen a tremendous search for yield in many markets and asset classes but deeply negative interest rates could also have perverse effects plunging bond yields erode returns on the safe and relatively liquid part of investors’ portfolios they also expose investors to volatility in their core fixed income holdings that they haven’t been used to when yields suddenly spike higher this could curb the desire to seek higher returns in equity and credit markets the opposite of what central banks sought to achieve with unconventional policies finally negative interest rates send the signal that the economy is in dire need of emergency support this could push consumer and business confidence lower because it signals that growth will remain low and weak for an extended period the markets’ questioning of negative interestrate policies suggests a tactically savvy ecb should rethink its strategy specifically the central bank could choose to keep its deposit rate unchanged next month and compensate with a largerthanexpected extension and increase in qe but we doubt it will choose this route deemphasizing negative interest rates as a policy tool could send the euro higher further dampening inflation expectations negative interest rates are an imperfect tool but our bet is that key central banks will continue to deploy them as long global disinflationary headwinds remain source url', 'the now prophecies messages from god video bill salus headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump

blockchain stocks are next originally published at blognormlorg those of us who support the full legalization of marijuana are greatly benefiting from political reforms adopted during what is frequently referred to as the progressive era in this country the principal objective of the progressive movement was eliminating corruption in government and to accomplish that goal proponents sought ways to take down the powerful and corrupt political bosses and to provide access by ordinary americans to the political system  a concept called direct democracy as contrasted to representative democracy it was during this period that the concept of direct primaries to nominate candidates for public office direct election of us senators and universal suffrage for women gained traction and most important to our work the procedures known as referendum and initiatives began to be adopted in several states in num oregon was the first state to adopt the option of initiative and referendum to change public policy permitting citizens to directly introduce or approve proposed laws or constitutional amendments this process was called an initiative if the change originated by action of citizens without the involvement of the legislature and as a referendum if it originated from the legislature but was referred to the voters to decide by num a total of num states had adopted provisions modeled on the oregon system today a total of num states offer a voter initiative in the rest of the states the only avenue to change public policy is through the state legislature this brief history of direct democracy is relevant today because it is this access to direct political action by voters that has allowed marijuana legalization to move forward years earlier than would have been politically possible through the action of state legislatures the four states and the district of columbia that have approved full legalization for all adults and the five states that will be voting on full legalization in november all rely on voter initiatives these progressive procedures have worked precisely as they were intended back in the progressive era they have allowed citizens to

the elected officials in those states it comes as no surprise that most elected officials do not appreciate the fact that public policies in their states can when necessary be changed without their consent as we approach the end of summer and the coming fall elections we once again see examples of the extraordinary time and resources many establishment politicians and other antimarijuana zealots are willing to invest to try to prevent citizens in their states from voting directly on marijuana policy the reason of course is obvious according to recent national polls a clear majority of the american public between num and num percent supports an end to marijuana prohibition if given the opportunity to vote on the issue they will vote to legalize marijuana elected officials who otherwise claim to represent the will of the voters in their states and other selfappointed moral guardians go to great lengths to try to stop the votes from happening democracy is something they support so long as the public favors the same policies they favor when the public gets out ahead of the establishment democracy be damned they will use any tools available including procedural and constitutional challenges to avoid allowing the voters to decide the issue full legalization proposals we will have full legalization measures on the ballot in five states this fall maine massachusetts nevada arizona and california a sixth michigan would have qualified but for lastminute legislation in several of the states with pending initiatives establishment prohibitionists have gone to court in a desperate effort to get the courts to intervene to keep the measures off the ballot in maine secretary of state matthew dunlap attempted to invalidate a significant number of the signatures gathered by the campaign to regulate marijuana like alcohol in maine arguing that the signature of a single notary did not match the one on file with the state fortunately superior court justice michaela murphy overruled dunlap’s decision when the signatures were recounted the measure question num qualified for the ballot in massachusetts once the secretary of state had qualified the legalization initiative for the ballot a group of prohibitionists calling themselves the safe and healthy massachusetts campaign sued to have the measure removed from the ballot claiming it violated the constitutional limitation prohibiting an initiative from dealing with two unrelated topics this challenge was subsequently dismissed by the massachusetts supreme judicial court and the measure question num will now appear on the november ballot in arizona a group calling itself arizonans for responsible drug policy — including two prominent country prosecutors and the arizona chamber of commerce — filed suit to try to keep the legalization initiative off the ballot after it had been qualified by the secretary of state the group claimed that the numword summary a limit set by statute did not accurately reflect everything contained in the numpage proposal maricopa county superior court judge jo lynn gentry rejected the argument and approved the measure proposition num for the ballot in california — the big enchilada for date elections and a state in which opponents to an initiative are permitted to include on the ballot their reasons for opposing the proposal — it was the proponents who went to court the yes on num advocates successfully challenged all six arguments that opponents had wanted to appear on the ballot and superior court judge shelleyanne wl chang found all six false and misleading she ordered the opponents to modify their arguments most of which falsely claimed the initiative would permit promarijuana ads to appear on radio and television and would appeal to children and in michigan where proponents mi legalize had turned in a sufficient number of signatures more than num to qualify a legalization measure for the ballot the state legislature quickly rammed through a new law in june declaring signatures older than num days to be invalid leaving proponents shy of the required number of signatures proponents have filed suit against the state challenging the new limitations on constitutional grounds but it appears the appeal will not be decided in time for the initiative to appear on date ballot even if the appeal succeeds of the five fulllegalization initiatives that will appear on the ballot this fall only the nevada initiative question num was free from a court challenge nevada secretary of state ross miller certified the proposal for the ballot at the end of num while there are certainly organized opponents none elected to challenge the measure in court moving forward in the short term proponents of legalization will continue to focus efforts in the states that offer the option of a voter initiative so long as our elected officials and the establishment interests they represent continue to support the status quo of prohibition it makes sense strategically to bypass the state legislature where possible but that is a strategy that must eventually evolve as num states simply do not offer that option for that half of the country we will have to win the oldfashioned way by building majority support among state legislators to pass the proposal through the legislature it’s a significant challenge for sure but as we’ve demonstrated with the drive to legalize medical marijuana after a few more states have adopted legalization by voter initiative enacting legalization by statute will become more realistic for those who live in one of the num states without an initiative process we must continue the painfully slow process of convincing individual legislators that prohibition of marijuana is a failed public policy and that full legalization makes sense many already understand this but continue to fear being labeled soft on drugs should they acknowledge the obvious it is frustrating to have to win over supporters one at a time but each year it becomes easier as public support for legalization continues to increase and elected officials ignore the wishes of their constituents at their own peril  this

and not some moneyloving narcissistic careerfocused sleep around that many women are her idea of a career is being at home looking after her man she loves to cook take care of the place loves my gorgeous german shepherd and they are best friends too she loves my family and close friends hangs about with women who are similar in their ideas and i get on well with their husbands because they too are real men they don’t all use antisocial media they meet and talk about nice things shun violence in films don’t gossip and all of them love to wear nice dresses and shoes nice hair and make up they look and act like women my wife is still young and has not one single tattoo on her body no pierced anything i have never heard her use bad language and not once have i had a row with her she’s not perfect nobody is but she’s as close to perfection you can find these days she’ll also get into the garden and work the plants and flowers while i do all the man work heavy lifting and other dirty jobs trendy modern males aka hipster that’s what women really want a real man and not some confused socially engineered pussy who thinks male anatomy is something he wants inside him i am self employed and support my wide she stays at home and takes care of business there i often receive comments from male friends asking how i found such a lovely person and get asked does she have a sister i know how fortunate i am to have a loving and caring wife who looks up to her man i am the head of the house and head of the relationship say that to a feminist and you’ll receive a load of vile abusive speech because those idiots have no clue about what being a woman is all about i take care of my wife and love her so much that no other woman nobody could even make me slightly tempted to go astray and sleep with her not ever imagining my gay life compare this to life as a gay person i am not hating gays at all i just hate what they do and how now they have so many ‘special rights’ so…i come home to steve he gives me a kiss and asks how my day was there’s no dinner on the table and the home looks almost and feels like a museum because that feminine touch is missing even though they act or think they act feminine they can’t ever be the same as a woman he’s also a career and money driven man he likely has met up with someone else who wants unsolicited sex today at least on some phone app to see what’s out there keeping his ‘options’ open we are off out later to meet more ‘friends’ who will likely bitch about everything flirt like crazy with each others partners maybe even take some of them back home for a group session later on secretly we feel very empty because we know something isn’t right something is missing that could be the natural desire fighting in the back of our minds the need for a woman then we get to the very unnatural part of our evening and have sex two males each with the exact same organs and anatomy making love not able to create anything other than confusion what is that really all about i can’t imagine living with a man excuse for one who gets into bed with me at night says he loves me and no doubt like most gays sleeps around like crazy and passes on whatever disease from one person to the next then i can’t have children he’s not going to feel the way my wife does about me never and i don’t feel that way about him and what a strange future to think that if it lasts you’ll grow old and gay and gray together yep society with its socalled ‘leaders’ have really screwed up what god put in place the marriage arrangement of male and female say that to a lot of people and get a load of abuse especially from feminists who even if they do believe in god will say it’s not a he god is a she nice one all the leaders of the illuminati for totally messing up the minds of many hope for single men there is hope but first you have to be a man you have to stop looking at porn and thinking sex is all there is to a relationship that’s immediate doom if you want a long lasting and happy relationship you have to start looking in the right places not night clubs dating sites or slutty milfs and cougars you need a good woman with a christian faith yes that’s right i said christian believe me if a woman follows bible principles she’ll respect and love you so long as she’s true to her faith and loves god god created us all and knows what’s best so if she loves him and is qualities she’ll love you so long as you imitate the qualities of god now you’re likely thinking you need god to get a woman well no but trust me my wife is the only woman i have ever known who loved god compared to previous partners who said that was stupid and evolution is the answer for life on earth she’s by far way ahead of them a christian woman is humble loving towards all especially her man and children does not care for the things in the world does not want multiple partners she does want a long lasting relationship show her you are the

next part num of a message received by mercedes kirkel on date hello everyone this is mary magdalene thank you to all of you who are listening and all of you who will be receiving this message in the future i am so very happy to connect with all of you i wish to say a little bit about myself at this point some of you may already know this and some of you may be less familiar with what i’m about to share i feel like it’s important to begin from this base of understanding about me and what i am bringing through at this time many of you are familiar with me as a person who was recorded in the bible as one of the followers of jesus my preferred way to refer to jesus is through the name yeshua which is his aramaic name aramaic was the language we were speaking at the time of his and my incarnation two thousand years ago so i will be referring to him as yeshua but this is the same one that many of you know as jesus my relationship with yeshua was a very sacred relationship everyone who was touched by him who was involved with him in any way had a sacred relationship with him i had the great great blessing and tremendous gift to be very close to him in fact to be in sacred relationship with him this is something i have explained in detail in the book mary magdalene beckons join the river of love this is something that was not recorded in the bible for various reasons the bible was recorded long after our lifetimes those who decided what would and what would not be included in the bible had their own decisions they were making and their own purposes as part of that it was decided that my story would largely not be included except in very skeletal form but in fact it is the case that i was yeshua’s partner and we were in sacred relationship together the reason for this is quite deep quite complex one aspect of it is that we both had work—very very profound and important spiritual work—that we were bringing forth it was understood that my part of this was to bring forth what i refer to as the divine feminine or the feminine face of god i was incarnated with yeshua as an example and a modeling of the union of divine masculine and divine feminine in the form of a human man and woman but we also understood—yeshua and myself and others as well—that the world at that time was not ready for this aspect of our work and the teaching that we were bringing forth—the aspect of the divine feminine the aspect of sacred relationship the aspect of god having attributes or aspects that were both masculine and feminine another way of saying this is fathermothergod at that time two thousand years ago the world was not prepared for this we understood this even back when we were both physically incarnated we knew that it would be two thousand years before the world was ready that time has come this is the time now not only is the world ready to receive the divine in feminine form and to receive my teaching of the divine feminine but the world needs this receiving the divine feminine is very crucial to your time period right now there are many who are aware of this i am not the first to say this and this occasion is certainly not the first time of this being stated many many people who are aware who are conscious and many people who are tuned into higher beings are quite cognizant of this that this is the time of the divine feminine coming through and coming forth and that this is absolutely necessary right now this is one of the reasons why i have been coming through to mercedes as well as to other people part of my work is to be a leader in the transformation that humans are in the process of undergoing this is a transformation from having the divine masculine as the predominant message you received and incarnated for a very long time that message has predominated both in terms of your spirituality and also in terms of your more mundane world and aspects of that world—your politics culture education and personal development all of these have been quite dominated by the masculine what you could call the divine masculine now it is time for the divine feminine to come forth to be incarnated to be understood and for all of you—men and women alike—to become strong in the feminine so that you can come into balance between the masculine and the feminine first and foremost this must happen within yourselves you all have your own inner feminine and masculine which is a reflection or manifestation of the divine feminine and divine masculine for all of you this is where the work originates within yourselves for many of you this will require strengthening the feminine because this has not been supported and developed for a very very long time even those of you who feel great love of the feminine and the divine feminine who feel very positively oriented toward the feminine even you often have work within yourselves to do to strengthen your inner feminine this is very practical work there are very practical arenas that need to be developed for this to become strong because it has been withheld from you in so many ways for so very long as i talked about in the messages that are recorded in the book mary magdalene beckons there are three primary arenas where the feminine needs to be strong it is within these three arenas that many people need to examine themselves and see what work they may have to do to complete the strengthening of the feminine within this is so important for people to do at this time first and foremost this is work for you to do with yourself for your own strengthening and balancing secondly this work needs to be done for your sacred relationships you will be engaging in your life that these can come into balance the third very important reason is that you are not only doing this work for yourself you do this as service to humanity for your whole world as you transform as you strengthen and develop and grow yourself you are affecting what is accessible for people what is available to people and what is becoming strong for your whole world any time you do growth and transformation work for yourself it affects everyone that is very very important at this time you are all at a very critical juncture where there is great opportunity opening up for your world and for human beings in particular to transition into a higher level of consciousness this will be reflected in a higher dimension of reality coming in and being the realm that you all inhabit that you know that you live in and are manifesting in this is the great opportunity you have at this time those of you who are on your spiritual path who are lightworkers very likely those of you who are listening to me at this time many of you are quite aware of this i and so many beings of the higher realms thank you for all that you are doing to support this amazing transformation that is underway in your world this is not only affecting the earth this transformation is so vast and involves so many places in your universe all of which you are affecting through the spiritual work you are doing it is most important we thank all of you for this i am aware that i have wandered away a bit from where i started which was explaining about the divine feminine and the arenas through which this manifests within each of you now i wish to return to that what i want to explain is that there are these three arenas that are the foundation of the divine feminine within each one of you the relationship with your physical body the relationship with your sexuality and the relationship with your emotions for each of you these are the places that i strongly urge you to examine and see what may need strengthening within yourself this is what i talked about in great depth in the messages i gave in the book mary magdalene beckons along with my guidance and instruction as to what each of you can do to strengthen these areas as i said at that time of these three the area that is most critical for the most people is the way that you respond to pain the area of emotions for many people is quite confusing your emotions are truly a gift from the divine that is rather unique to human beings in your realm yet many of you do not yet fully understand how to receive this gift that has been given to you in the emotional realm and how to work with emotions particularly your painful emotions this is the part that is most challenging for many of you you did not receive help and support and guidance in understanding the pathway of how to respond to painful emotions how to receive the gift from god that’s being given to you through these emotions and how to make use of emotions to support your spiritual journey to support your uniting with god because you did not receive that instruction and that guidance and because you do not fully understand it i especially focused on that in my earlier messages that are recorded in mary magdalene beckons i gave detailed instruction about how you can respond differently to your painful emotions in a way that will be most supportive of you most supportive of your spiritual connection and most supportive of your forward movement in your spiritual evolution i did this because from my vantage point this is the area that is holding most people back from their spiritual growth in general and specifically from the incarnation of the divine feminine this is why i said earlier that while many of you are so positively oriented to the divine feminine and the feminine in all her forms which is a most wonderful thing even so for many of you there may still be work to do in these three arenas and especially in the emotional arena in terms of how you respond to pain i urge you to make use of the instruction i have given and to learn these pathways of incarnating the divine feminine which will support you and help to transform you and in that process transform your world  copyrdate

stocks are next i don’t know about you but life seems pretty stressful at the moment so these suggestions for ways to help tackle anxiety from health and fitness expert and former schoolteacher brian keane couldn’t have come at a better time anxiety is one of the most common mental health issues according to a threeyear study by the office of national statistics url brian keane said he suffered from anxiety while working as a teacher he found himself having sleepless nights and consistently worried about his performance at work for four years brian worried about his sleep pattern and his working life which resulted in him consuming sugary foods and drinks to maintain his energy brian said i always thought anxiety meant that you didn’t have your life together  regardless of what you may see nobody has every area of their life together  and my only experience with anxiety was when colleagues would get signed off work due to stress i didn’t have enough selfawareness to realise that it’s something that all of us face at some time or another and for some people it’s chronic and affects them every single day for others it can be chemically induced  too much caffeine alcohol and drugs regardless the more people i meet the more i realise that everyone experiences anxiety in some way shape or form there are some serious cases of anxiety and if you have suffered any major physical or mental trauma or have a hormonal imbalance it would be probably best to consult your physician however i hope by sharing my own experiences and strategies i will ultimately support you in managing any kind of daytoday anxiety or worry that may be limiting you in any aspect of your own life brian keane’s new book the fitness mindset which achieved eight weeks at the top of the amazon bestseller’s chart has tips on improving fitness and how to achieve a mindset to overcome obstacles such as anxiety and stress it addresses tactics brian has discovered when working to overcome his own anxiety below are some of the top tips he has discovered recognise the source of your anxiety ‘find the source fix the problem’ for some of us it is as simple as cutting off the source of anxiety in my case there were certain people in my life who just made me feel ‘off’ i felt more insecure around them and even though i called them friends in truth they weren’t if there are people in your life that make you feel this way brian recommends minimising the amount of time you spend with them or cut them off completely sometimes it’s as simple as finding the people who make you feel happy and spending more time with them train exercise or meditate brian said for years i used the gym and my training as an outlet so they always acted as plasters that temporarily healed the problem if i felt i was on the edge i never dealt with it or asked myself who or what was making me feel this way i just went to the gym i was effectively ‘selfmedicating’ with exercise in my opinion it’s actually the best way to reduce short as well as long term anxiety but it’s imperative to follow step one and then use training exercise and meditation as ways to support you and not just put a lid over the real problem don’t eat foods that make your anxiety worse brian said knowing how certain foods can send my body into a spiral of ‘fight or flight’ has helped support me massively over the past few years if your body is intolerant or allergic to certain foods or if you react to certain additives flavourings and preservatives that can be found in heavily processed food then it’s worth keeping note of how you feel if these ingredients feature heavily in your diet for example i know if i eat too much dairy sugar or gluten my brain will feel foggy the next day and i won’t have the same steady energy and mood that i normally have everyone reacts differently to certain foods and ingredients so experiment with it yourself i’ve largely eliminated these ingredients and foods and very rarely get any physiological anxiety issues anymore if you still find yourself getting edgy and anxious for no apparent reason  it’s not about money a relationship or a job and you just feel ‘off’  then i highly recommend having a look at your nutrition and checking if certain foods you consume are causing you to feel this way you can view the fitness mindset on amazon it is published by rethink pres links

blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next received by mercedes kirkel on date note from mercedes this is an excerpt from a channeled reading with a client who graciously agreed to share this portion because of the universal nature and profundity of mary’s responses question my question has to do with releasing shame all my life i’ve felt like i’m not good enough or i’m bad or something’s wrong with me i’m currently going through therapy for a substanceabuse problem and healing that i think a big part of that healing is releasing my shame any guidance you can give me on that would be helpful mary magdalene this is very wonderful that you have identified the connection between shame and using substances you’re getting to a very deep level and that is where the healing can occur i acknowledge you for your awareness of the connection between these and your openness to healing the shame that you carry are there particular arenas in your life that you feel or experience shame questioner a big one is that i even have this substanceabuse problem i feel so shameful about it like i’m wrong and bad it’s a substance abuse to prescription medications that got out of hand and now i’m working on it i feel so much shame that i’ve spent the last ten years of my life with this substanceabuse problem mary magdalene what were these medications originally prescribed for questioner it was for attention deficit disorder i’m really sensitive and it helped me to kind of shut off my feelings so i could focus and do work sometimes i think i’m not cut out for this world i’m too sensitive too emotional i can’t be like that if i need to work and do the practical things of life so that’s what it was prescribed for but i’m at a point now where i don’t want to take the medication any more i want to love and respect my body mary magdalene so is it simply that you’re wanting to get off the medication that’s been prescribed or have you taken the medication in ways that it wasn’t prescribed questioner both i’ve taken it in ways that weren’t prescribed and i’m working with a therapist to get off of it it’s only in the past two months that i’ve been able to acknowledge this and been honest about it so i’d like any guidance about getting off of it but also help with this shame i feel around it there’s another shame too that started when i was really young this was the first shame which i’m just starting to realize when i was really young like still in diapers i masturbated growing up in a catholic household i knew that it was so shameful and i still feel so much shame around that now i was so young i don’t know why i did it mary magdalene thank you for speaking this when one has shame even speaking it is difficult because there is so much fear about being ostracized being abandoned if you show people the part of yourself that you feel shame for so speaking about it is the beginning of healing it shows that first you’ve become aware and honest with yourself that this is what’s going on that you have these areas that you have shame about then you begin to find people who you can trust who it’s safe to share this with and open up this part of yourself to them that in and of itself is a great step of healing you need to have discernment in speaking to others about this it is important to only open yourself up with people who you discern that are safe there are people who it may not be safe to open up to people who may not understand or hold these events in the same way you do it is not necessary or even wise for you to open up to those people you can be in choice about who the people are who are safe for you to open up to the people who will be supportive for you to open up to who actually will help you in the ways that you are wanting help so be very aware of your choice and start to empower yourself to be in choice rather than being at the effect of random responses from random individuals how does that part feel to you questioner that feels good that gives me a lot of security and guidance mary magdalene yes this is the beginning of reclaiming your own personal power when there’s shame you have given away a part of your power to someone or some entity that you probably trusted now at the stage of life you’re currently in you may realize that they weren’t entirely trustable or they weren’t entirely for your highest good they gave you messages that what you were doing was bad wrong sinful evil or that somehow you yourself were bad wrong sinful evil or deficient not right not good enough because you were engaging certain behaviors this is a very sad state of affairs it is a very thirddimensional issue because in the thirddimensional consciousness there is a very strong belief in these dualities of goodbad rightwrong evilgodly those kinds of things at the higher dimensions we see things very differently we see those kinds of dualities as quite destructive quite harmful to people’s spiritual growth and their spiritual path part of the spiritual process at the third dimension is realizing that many people have been programmed with this kind of thinking that certain things are good and certain things are bad certain things are godly and certain things are ungodly that kind of thing those beliefs are not a given it is a choice to hold such beliefs i would like to suggest a very different possibility which from my point of view is part of the transcendence of the third dimension and moving into a higherdimensional consciousness that possibility is to see that there is no such thing as goodbad there is no such thing as rightwrong all there are is experiences that are either supporting you or not supporting you in your divine growth and unfoldment when you were very young and you were touching yourself or experiencing your sexual energy through forms of touch and selfpleasuring in whatever way you did this certainly was not bad or wrong in any way at all from my point of view i see it as a completely natural thing to do because you were becoming aware of your physical body and your energy—including your sexual energy which is connected to your physical body you were exploring that to me that is as healthy as learning how to walk where you’re exploring your physical body and its possibilities for mobility no one said you were bad or wrong or evil for exploring movement and walking i certainly don’t see you as any more bad wrong or evil for learning about and exploring your sexual energy and your physical sexuality i see it as most unfortunate that institutions such as the catholic church have promoted this belief that you are bad wrong sinful or whatever else for doing what i consider to be not only a very natural thing but a healthy thing sexuality is part of who we are it’s no more evil than your appetite for food people don’t call being hungry and having a meal evil hunger is simply an energy you have in your body that’s connected to physical systems that are natural to your body the same is true of sexuality however sexuality has the potential for connecting you with god in a very profound way a way that for most people is much more profound than most of your other bodily functions in fact this is why religious institutions have tried to convince people that sexuality is bad wrong or whatever if you did not have that belief if you believed or understood that your sexuality is natural healthy important and a vital part of your life of connection to god you would be a naturally empowered person—empowered to transcend the limitations of the third dimension and thirddimensional thinking those institutions have not wanted people to become empowered in that way because they benefited from people’s separation from their own power people’s obedience to them and placing them in a position of power this is all part of the thirddimensional legacy it’s all part of what beings are learning about and learning to transcend and grow beyond in their experience in coming to earth not only is it part of your spiritual path to explore your sexuality but it is part of your spiritual path to go beyond the limitations of the thinking that says your sexuality is shameful or sinful in any way to go beyond being limited by this kind of belief structure so from my point of view in many ways you are right on course you’re having your experience of having been limited by having taken on these belief systems which was probably a very natural understandable thing to do because you encountered them as a child very likely the ones who you were trusting to discern for you which beliefs were supportive for you to take on believed this so you took it on because they believed it but now you are an adult you are growing and maturing spiritually this is your time to become aware and conscious of what you choose to believe what you choose to follow what ideas you choose to empower as things that seem true in the sense that they are consistent with your own experience and your own guidance i am guessing from what you’ve said that you no longer ascribe to the beliefs that sexuality or even masturbation is inherently wrong or bad or sinful and yet you are struggling with earlier programming is that right questioner correct mary magdalene even this kind of conversation can be immensely helpful in understanding that that is just one option amongst many many options from my point of view you were probably a sensitive child your awareness of energy was probably very high so you were naturally aware of your sexual energy at a young age possibly younger than many other people and you were empowering yourself to explore this these are all very wonderful things from my point of view there is certainly no harm that i am aware of that can come to a child from exploring their sexuality masturbating and having orgasms but because of their programming other individuals—very likely including your family members—may have been uncomfortable with this it may have been in conflict with their beliefs or the level of shame that they carried or their comfort around sexuality altogether because of the programming they received and ascribed to in fact the problem was probably much more on the part of those who told you that you were wrong maybe they didn’t even tell you that maybe they just were experiencing that within themselves and because you are a very sensitive being you picked up on their discomfort their conflict and their beliefs and you took that on does that seem accurate questioner that’s exactly how it seems mary magdalene so the first part is to realize that these were really their issues their difficulty their challenges that you took on not your own you were simply being your own natural sensitive self what’s important is to realize that the decision of yours to take on their issues as your own issues was your choice of course you were very young and it is natural to do things like that when you are young but nevertheless it was a choice now you have the choice to no longer continue to take on those beliefs or those conflicts that others are carrying can you sense this in yourself questioner yes absolutely mary magdalene again it does not mean that you need to go telling everyone you meet that you feel differently or that you have a different point of view that may not be supportive you are in choice about who you share this with but you can certainly do this for yourself in relationship to these arenas you can do this relative to sexuality and you can also do this relative to your use of the medicine that you were taking i have been shown very strongly that whenever a being makes a choice there are always very wonderful or you could say beautiful reasons for that choice those reasons are what i have called your inner divine qualities when you made the choice to first take the medicine and then later to take it more than was being prescribed you had very important reasons why you made that choice it doesn’t mean that the outcome of that choice—the outcome of the behaviors that you chose to engage—are ones that you are pleased about it could be that you look at the outcome of those behaviors and you regret that choice you regret that you chose to act upon your motivations in that particular way but regret and shame are very different things regret is part of the human experience humans makes choices in retrospect some of the choices you are happy about and some of the choices you are not happy about both serve your growth so it is fine to make choices that you are not happy about that is part of the growth process when you realize you’ve made choices you’re not happy about most humans experience regret but if you have been given the program that whenever you feel regret it means you’re a bad person then very likely that regret will turn into shame shame is saying there’s something defective about me because i made this choice or i took this action that is based on a combination of regret and judgment you’re making judgments about yourself such as i should have known better i should have been stronger i shouldn’t have been vulnerable to this kind of artificial support are you making those kinds of judgments about yourself questioner yes mary magdalene are there other judgments that you’re making too questioner it tends to be the same things i shouldn’t have done that i should be stronger i shouldn’t be so emotional … mary magdalene i should know better i should be more stable i should be more like other people who don’t have these problems those kinds of things questioner absolutely mary magdalene yes there’s something the matter with me that i can’t do it right questioner exactly mary magdalene when you set all those judgments aside are you able to feel something different in terms of an emotion other than shame relative to your taking this medicine questioner yes mary magdalene what is it that comes up questioner more compassion mary magdalene and perhaps regret or sadness for the situation that you’re in questioner yes sadness and regret but especially when you were talking about the inner divine qualities then i feel compassion mary magdalene yes there are two things you have sadness that engaging with these medicines hasn’t supported you in the way that you were hoping is that true questioner correct mary magdalene and it has had some negative ramifications is that right questioner yes mary magdalene yes what i would like to look at are the inner divine qualities that you were hoping to fulfill by taking this medicine and even taking more than was prescribed what were you hoping to accomplish by that consciously or unconsciously questioner power over myself—being powerful also being productive getting stuff done being able to connect with people i think i also used the medicine to mask some depression as well so i wanted to be joyful and happy to connect with people and give that joy and happiness to people mary magdalene beautiful this is the important thing that will help you the most with shame it is to realize there were very valid important and even beautiful reasons why you were making these choices you wanted to have power over yourself you wanted to be productive and functional you wanted to connect with others you wanted joy in your life these are wonderful important things that everyone needs in their life you were choosing this modality of trying to accomplish these things perhaps it didn’t work the way that you were hoping but that doesn’t mean that you are a bad person it simply means you made a choice that didn’t work out the way that you were hoping now what you can do is take steps to make a different choice take steps to get off of the substance if that’s what you choose to do or whatever seems like the wisest choice now to accomplish these same things because it’s still important that you have all of these things that you feel empowered that you are functional and productive that you connect with others and that you have joy in your life you still need all of those things you can simply shift from this selfjudgment and paralyzing position of i’m bad to i tried something it didn’t work the way i had hoped now i’m going to look at what else i can do to fulfill these important inner divine qualities how does that land with you questioner that’s very helpful and feels very healing mary magdalene wonderful hopefully you are finding people who can support you in finding practical steps you can take to fulfill these inner divine qualities which will support you in better ways than the ways you were trying through the medicine i highly recommend that you also change your languaging rather than saying i have a substanceabuse problem—because you’re labeling yourself as one who’s involved in abuse—say i have a problem with my use of this medication it’s not supporting me i want to change that simply state what is without any judgment can you feel the difference questioner absolutely yes laughing thank you that feels so much better mary magdalene laughing wonderful questioner i have another question about depression i have a big fear of depression i anticipate having depression as a result of the chemical changes i’m going to have in my body through going off this medication i think i started to use the medication to mask some depression it’s really the fatigue and lack of motivation that i don’t like mary magdalene yes so that is wonderful because now you’re getting to the root of the issues that motivated you originally to use the medication and again you can look at other options it may be that you need medication to help you with depression but you can look at using medication as one option you can look at which medications would be most helpful if you choose to engage medication find someone who can help you with your full spectrum of concerns you may want to work with someone more naturally oriented who is open to the use of medications as one option and who can help you sort through all the various possibilities as well as your concerns then they can help you to come up with a holistic program that will be tailored to you and will hopefully help you the best they can also help you to monitor the program and how it’s working for you then if you start with a medication and find out it’s not working the way you hoped or it has consequences you didn’t realize beforehand you can make choices about what steps to take you can also start to look at natural options for handling depression there may be things in your diet that could change the actual biochemistry in your body there could be things like exercise there could be certain social engagements or a support group of some sort or other working with a therapist or a coach there may be all kinds of things so i suggest that you get a support person who you like where they’re coming from who you trust and who you feel has the understanding of the full picture so they can help you to access all the different kinds of resources you may need questioner thank you that’s very helpful

researchers in a scientific lab and they are trying to like study the whole fertilization process and trying to determine what genes do what and i am seeing like this board on the wall and it will say blue eye and like have notation beside it it is not legible to me and written in scientific lingo and then it will say like brown eyes blonde hair like all these different attributes like a person could have it is a huge list and they are trying to scientifically figure out how to create humans with certain physical characteristics and intelligence then the next thing that i see is a couple and they are in a waiting room in a doctors office and it is like the guy is holding the woman’s hands and she looks like she has been crying and my impression is that they are wanting a child they cannot get pregnant and they are at that desperation phase the i see a dr take them back and start to explain different fertility options and then the doctors are handing the couple a menu like they can custom order their baby and it feels to me that dr’s are preying upon emotions of people who cannot have kids collecting huge amounts of money for fertility procedures to fund the bigger picture of studying and learning how to customize babies i feel like these reality shows are out there to one let people know that all these procedures exist but secondly to desensitize you to everything that they are doing and it is like i am hearing some futuristic slogan of why adopt just customize your baby or something like that that is all i initially get qwhy do feel many couples are infertile ai see a person standing…and they have what looks like these waves like bombarding their body even going through their body and it feels like we are so bombarded with electronic or magnetic waves that it pollutes your body and that is why i feel like when you are younger it is usually easier to get pregnant than when you are older and that is in part due to the toxin buildup in your body from these waves that are constantly bombarding it qdo you feel people today actually select their true genetic mates based off nature pheromones and a mate that is a compliment to their own dna vs less compatible mates based on other factors ai see that as individualized for the person so some people yes and some people no but the thing that i do see is that people with long lasting relationships that are created from their own free choice are generally more compatible the less compatible people i feel have very short lived relationships qdo you see all babies being test tube babies in the future and if so how long from now afor the first part i do not see all babies being test tube babies i feel like the test tube babies are more for the wealthy or people who are able to come up with the funding for it i feel like it is going to be in the date′s or edate′s when it is like launched and society starts to accept it i see there being like a huge controversial thing leading up to it and it will take a while for this to be acceptable and part of the media now is just to kind of in small doses get people familiar with alternative ideas and i keep feeling there is a huge amount of money to be made in this industry qis it motivated by money more than by helping ayes because i just keep feeling that money part of it qwhen does conception start ai keep seeing it as when the first cell divides qtime frame from when sperm meets egg ai keep seeing num it might be num minute but i am leaning towards num hour qdefine conception when soul spirit life force whatever enters the cell what is it ai see it as a golden light shooting into the woman’s stomach and as a cell divides it starts to glow and i feel like it is combination of spirit with universal knowledgethat nugget…enters the cell right in that moment when it divides qso with in vitro fertilization the sperm and egg are combined outside the body does conception still happen without the woman ayes but it is weird i am getting a picture of a person and they look like they are catatonic so i feel like until it is implanted in the woman like the warmth and personality does not penetrate the embryo it is like something is not right with the fertilized egg until it is in the woman qhave children been born without the use of a mother or surrogate ai am getting no because you still need the placenta to provide nourishment to the baby and there is no way to replicate that qwhy can human embryos not be implanted into animal host mothers ait has something to do with their blood there is some kind of blood exchange or something with the blood that makes it not possible qlike why can a primate not carry a human embryo is that combination possible ai do not know i just keep getting something about the blood qdo we pick our own parents when we incarnate ahmm qi do not feel like we pick our own parents but we pick like the situation or circumstances we live in…to complete our life lessons and to spiritually evolve i feel like on the other side of life we all have the same goal to evolve to the next dimension but it is unclear to us now in our earthly bodies but i think that when we die all of that becomes very clear ais abortion wrong qwell there is two sides to it one that is the individuals choice and they have to live with the decision that they made but then the second side of it is in some ways i feel it might be fate that maybe it was soul that jumped in too soon and it just was not ready to incarnate yet in some ways it is even a life lesson for the person that is experiencing the abortion because i see a person walking around and it is almost like they are hunch backed with a big weight on their shoulders and they have to carry that emotional weight of that decision forever and i feel like maybe that is one of their life lessons during their existence qis the us or other countries currently producing menu babies athey are not producing now but there are other countries studying and on a map i see the central part of europe lighting up and also the middle of china lighting up qdo you see this as a good or bad thing for humanity aas soon as you said that it wasn’t necessarily good or bad but i heard the phrase is it moral or immoral and then i see these like wealthy parts of society and everyone looks so similar i feel like it just takes the randomness out of life the movie stepford wives keeps playing in my head it is like everybody is so so similar qdo you have anything else to add and what is your impression of this reading ai do not have anything else i think it was a really interesting reading before this i had never really thought about science going in that direction as i did the reading i feel uneasy that society could move that way i feel like it really segregates people like there is this average population of just like normal folks and then there is like this elite population of what people define as beautiful people and it just feels really strange qi think there was movie called gattaca with a similar concept but only the elite could have certain jobs like there was a lot discrimination to the natural born numnum pm

some psychic abilities mainly psychometry paranormal and lately remote viewing things come to me in the form of pictures in my mind feelings and impressions and sometimes sounds i typically get them when asked to focus on specific objects or events i clear my mind think of the question or object and this blog is an example of what i get this blog is a way for me to organize all my thoughts numnum pm today i wanted to do a short response to some questions i recevied on the zimmerman case so here they are… q with regards to the trayvon martin case did it really happened the way zimmerman said it did did trayvon threw the first punch a i definitely see that trayvon was uncomfortable… i also get a suspicious vibe like martin didn’t do anything yet but it was because he felt he was being watched i’m getting an image of someone working security undercover security at a department store and watching someone being martin to make sure they don’t steal something the person watched doesn’t realize it at first but they are lurking around and not just going from point a to point b i just see this lingering… then there comes a point where martin realizes that he is being watched… at that point he gets angry more that his lingering got interrupted more than the straight up fact that he was being watched i see that he referring to martin felt like zimmerman was a rude interruption to something… exactly like he was rudely interrupted martin got really defensive and i see him as the first to yell it was in an irate way zimmerman didn’t back down and stood there confidently i see martin had the chance to leave then very early on and he didn’t take it because he was so angry at this point i start to hear a lot of foul language the f word is being used both ways and i hear the phrase pissed and pissed off with that focusing more on martin now i see martin doing some kind of a boxers tiptoe dance and bouncing around it was like martin knew there was going to be a fight and he wanted a chance to have the first punch martin wasn’t scared he was so full of adrenaline my heart is beating hard martin was focused it does appear that martin did throw the first punch q was the screaming trayvon’s a as i focus on that i hear martin’s side yelling but not making words just sounds as they are fighting more like a growl it was as if when he exhaled it was a sound rather than a breath i do see zimmerman yelling… which leads to the next question that was asked… q zimmerman’s account does not add up if he had a gun why would he be screaming for help a i see he had a gun but didn’t want to use it he was screaming trying to get people to help so martin could be restrained and taken in i don’t see that he sought out to shoot him he wanted martin to realize that he was being watched so if he didn’t intend to do some kind of crime or tell he friends about a possible crime that his appearance had been known i keep flashing back to wisteria lane on desperate housewives and feel the neighborhood had a closeness about it as wisteria lane did so to yell for help feels right and normal i see that zimmerman carried a gun like an insurance policy never really thinking he would ever need to use it even as he grabbed he was kind of awkward like he didn’t make a fluid motion for it and those are the questions i have received so far it is numnum pm link to audio source url',

thing i hear in my head is that each storm will be more grandiose that the last then i see a chess board…as if each side is taking turns back and forth…it looks like they are playing chicken with one another to see who do what and by saying they’re i am referring to the united states…i want to say japan but i feel like they are somehow interconnected with china…russia is starting to become a player but they are kind of behind with technology those are the main counties i see involved with regards to the weather in num i see the northeastern part of the united states being a target with a focus on ny then i hear a phrase the surrounding states are just collateral damage i see a bunch of swirls on a map that are white indicating blizzard type storms just one after another again with a focus on ny i am getting the reason that there is such an imbalance in the weather is because as we receive an attack that causes inclimate weather we try to counteract it with these unseasonably warm weather conditions and even though the result may be storms or tornadoes it felt that it is less severe than the inclimate weather and the us is not good at regulating how severe it be it seems to be full blast in the cold direction or full blast in the hot direction i see that in the early summer around the end of may there is going to be really bad storm on the southeast coast clear from florida up to south carolina it looks like a bad hurricane and it blows just right up the whole coast in the summer i see a big line of fire…and it looks to be on the western side of illinois and it spans the whole length of the state my mind wants to tell me forest fire but without a map i can’t be sure in the washington state area i keep seeing icefall and it looks like big long icicles and it looks like a severe ice storm in store for that area when i ask myself if there is a way to stop them it looks as if it would be very difficult the picture in my mind is a group of people in the top of a tower and there is a mob of people beneath them on the ground and there is no way to reach the people in the tower weather manipulators it is as if they are untouchable q why is ny the focus a ok i am getting a lot of reasons coming in…one that it is an older city and it is vulnerable because of it’s position it is a financial heartbeat of the country and i see a map of the us and ny is pulsating like a heart it is really population dense so a hardship really affects a lot of people q please tell us about how the fukushima problems will impact the world hopefully enough people will focus on healing fukushima that it will avoid any major impact on the earth a the first thing i see is litter and the trash washing up on the beaches…i also see a lot of seafoam and at first it seems cool but as people start to put their hands or feet into it it has this coating about it that feels like soap scum the other image i have too is big fishing boats that are in the pacific are getting a lot of garbage in their fishing nets i am seeing an image of someone on a boat and they spot what looks like a big school of jellyfish and when the get close enough to examine it it is like a ton of these plastic bags it is like the garbage floats in schools i get that people become very concerned with consuming the fish out of that part of the pacific ocean to the point where a lot of people in the us won’t even buy it i also see orange dust in the air over the west coast and i see these vineyards in california being concerned with the dust on their grapes it is like it is killing the grapes it is like dust that comes over in clouds from the pacific moving in an eastern direction i see fukushima mainly affecting the countries that are to the east i mean the water and the air is all tainted but it is much more diluted to the countries to the west of fukushima so the eastern countries will have the higher effects of radiation and pollution q hi just wondering on news on your red comet is the red comet ison or is it yet to come storms here have been the worst in num yrs a ok when i ask for the name i am not given a name but i am given a picture what i see is the earth this comet the red comet’ and the sun being in perfect alignment right now and the reason that this comet is hard to see is because it is directly in front of the sun and the brightness of the sun blinds us from it then i am getting a phrase saying i haven’t given you a name but i have given you everything you need to know q regarding the latest storm to hit the philippines was this a man made storm and what was its purpose i read that the water fueled car was about to be marketed there could that be one of the reasons for the weather attack a i see we were trying to get the phillippines to join us by getting members of their government to form an allied group and they resisted i see this american guy in a suit and he is trying to put his arm around this philippine guy’s shoulder the philippine guy totally resisted and the american guy had an arrogance about him and was completely offended then i see two kids picking at each other one pokes the other and says how do you like that and then the other picks back and says what about that and it does look to me that we retaliated because they did not want to be in business with us us but i also get this feeling of regret or remorse like it went way too far there is like some shame and embarrassment associated with it too when i ask if it was associated to the car i just see a big field full of oil pumps working so in my mind the answer is that it was related to the car numnum pm link to audio source url', 'hubble captures incredibly rare image of exploding star  of readers think this story is fact add your two cents headline bitcoin

the researchers were able to measure the hubble constant to a precision of num percent — the most accurate measurement made thus far prior measurements of the hubble constant utilized cepheid variable

policy could not work for widely differing national economies in num  at a time when the prime minister tony blair was positioning the uk to join the euro with the fullhearted support of the cbi and

credit it should be spread very very broadly i was just the chairman on the issue of enlargement leach remarked that ‘the democratic deficit … gets worse every time there is more europe’ in num he set up open europe a thinktank dedicated to scrutinising and challenging every aspect of the european project from the minutiae of financial regulation to the constitutional issues of enlargement on which leach remarked that the democratic deficit … gets worse every time there is more europe but his approach was constructive having won the battle against euro membership he said we now want to fight a much longer war to make something good happen his vision was of a much more efficient europe… that britain would be at ease with a neighbourly alliance in which those nations that wanted to share economic sovereignty and those that just wanted cooperation and trade would be equally welcome as for date referendum on uk membership of the eu leach condemned what he called adversarial claptrap from the opposing politicians and was guarded in expressing his own preference in contrast to many voices warning that brexit could bring economic disaster open europe’s research indicated that the impact of british departure could be positive or negative depending on subsequent trade deals and deregulation measures  but either way was likely to be relatively modest in scale in an interview for the spectator conducted in february before david cameron’s renegotiation of membership terms leach spoke of the value of continuing uk pressure for eu reform and seemed to lean towards remain he had still made no public declaration when in midapril while chairing an open europe debate he suffered a severe stroke however an email he had sent to a friend in march was subsequently published we

realdonaldtrump date though the nra came under scrutiny because it opposed denying guns to those on the federal government’s list with suspected terrorists links and later stated it supports keeping firearms away from terrorists the group maintains it has not changed its position the nra also said wednesday it would be happy to meet with trump who it endorsed at its annual meeting last month the nra believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms period the group said in a statement anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the fbi and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing if an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement the government should be allowed to immediately go to court block the sale and arrest the terrorist at the same time due process protections should be put in place that allow lawabiding americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be

next as we reported in just the past week not only has nato accelerated its encirclement of russia with british soldiers deployed in estonia us soldiers operating in latvia and canadians in poland while combat units are being increased in the mediterranean… … but even more troubling was nato’s assessment that it may now have grounds to attack russia when it announced that if a nato member country becomes the victim of a cyber attack by persons in a nonnato country such as russia or china then nato’s article v collective defense provision requires each nato member country to join that nato member country if it decides to strike back against the attacking country specifically nato is alleging that because russian hackers had copied the emails on hillary clinton’s home computer this action of someone in russia taking advantage of her having privatized her us state department communications to her unsecured home computer and of such a russian’s then snooping into the us state department business that was stored on itmight constitute a russian attack against the united states of america and would if the us president declares it to be a russian invasion of the us trigger nato’s mutualdefense clause and so require all nato nations to join with the us government in going to war against russia if the us government so decides also recall that the attack on the dnc servers which leaked the democrats confidential files on trump and hillary donors lists were also blamed on russian government hackers before it emerged that the act was the result of one solitary nonrussian hacker but not before the us once again tried to escalate a development which may have culminated with war with russia throughout all of these escalations the popular narrative spun by the democratic media was a simple one it was russia that was provoking nato not nato’s aggressive military actions on the border with russia that were the cause of soaring geopolitical tension ignored in the fictional plot line was also russia’s clear reaction to nato provocations that it would respond totally asymmetrically an outcome that could in its worst oucome lead to millions of european deaths still no matter the risk of escalation one which just two weeks ago led to assessment that the risk of nuclear dirty bomb surges on poor usrussia relations nato had to maintain its provocative attitude  all nato had to do was assure that all alliance members would follow the lead and nobody would stray from the party line and then everything imploded when none other than the foreign minister of nato member germany frankwalter steinmeiercriticized nato for having a bellicose policy towards russia describing it as warmongering the german daily bild reported and just like that the entire ficitional narrative of innocent nato merely reacting to evil russian provcations has gone up in flames as afp adds steinmeier merely highlighted all those things which rational persons have known about for a long time namely the deployment of nato troops near borders with russia in the military alliance’s baltic and east european member states however since it comes from a nato member suddenly one can’t accuse russian propaganda in fact nato has absolutely no planned response to just this contingency what we should avoid today is inflaming the situation by warmongering and stomping boots steinmeier told bild in an interview to be published sunday german foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier anyone who thinks you can increase security in the alliance with symbolic parades of tanks near the eastern borders is mistaken germany’s top diplomat added needless to say russia bitterly opposes nato’s expansion into its sovietera satellites and last month said it would create three new divisions in its southwest region to meet what it described as a dangerous military buildup along its borders this is precisely what nato wants as it would be able to then blame russian effect to nato cause as an irrational move by the kremlin one to which the kind folks at nato hq would have no choice but to respond in their caring defense of all those innocent people when in reality it is nato that is desperate to provoke and launch the conflict with russia and now even its own members admit it in its latest ridiculous escalation blamed on russia no less nato announced on monday that it would deploy four battalions to estonia latvia lithuania and poland to counter a more assertive russia ahead of a landmark summit in warsaw next month well as steinmeier made it very clear nato’s deployment to provoke russia was precisely that as a result a russian assymmetric response is assured and this time it may even spill over into the combat arena something which would bring infinite delight to washington’s militaryindustrial complex neocon puppets in an interview with bild on thursday nato chief jens stoltenberg said russia is seeking to create a zone of influence through

democrat frankly he’s a smoothtalking todd akin—the republican former us representative from missouri who famously tried to limit federal funding for abortion to women who suffered what he called

of who has been so completely obsessed with planned parenthood planned parenthood president cecile richards said back then this just seems to be an enormous focus of his of course pence got more company in the tea party congress of num and that year he threatened to shut down the government over continued planned parenthood funding since becoming governor in num pence has signed various antiabortion bills and succeeded in defunding planned parenthood in his state that helped lead to a devastating resurgence of hivaids since planned parenthood was one of a few providers of hiv testing in the state unfortunately there’s not much daylight between trump and pence on the issue of planned parenthood although daughter ivanka reportedly got trump to say nice things about the group’s women’shealth work earlier this year both he and pence have said that if planned parenthood wants to continue providing primary care for women and crucial screenings for breast and cervical cancers it should stop providing abortions … also trump has promised to punish women for getting abortions and then flipflopped pence has actually done so in indianapolis numyearold purvi patel was prosecuted

sheep among the wolves luke num num by sasha spencer henrymakowcom from date we all know that hollywood is perverse but an insider has posted new information that is beyond the pale it confirms everything i encountered when i flitted along the margins of show business in date′s and much more including human cloning and child sacrifice film sets are sexually highly charged my own encounters with showbiz strangeness ran the usual gamut of offers to sleep and play with producers and other power players group sex and so on or upon being cast as the lead in a play in a fairly large city which could have really helped me along i realized that i needed to live with and sleep with the octogenarian director for the duration of the theater run i declined the part or finding out a cast member’s girlfriend is really a shemale or a famous countrywestern singer likes to be used as a human toilet or going back stage to meet danny thomas the star of make room for daddy after a performance he grabbed me and rammed his tongue down my throat what price to make it in show biz there are two realities to the industry first there are the insider blood line types who when they get out of film school a call is made and the career is launched shirley maclaine and warren beatty might be an an example many of these people come from multigenerational abuse families it also helps if you are jewish i am not then there are the nobodies who eventually come across the pay to play scenario basically prostitution sleeping with producers directors and so on and being on call as an escort if you say no your career goes nowhere according to author darwin porter many stars including james dean rock hudson marilyn monroe and lucille ball started their careers as prostitutes hoover  tolson sexual secrets of americas most famous men and women num that is why you have never heard of me the author of the expose and i both shared the moniker of right brain creative types who were idealistic and naive about the world it’s what saved us both in the long run the grooming stage in order to reach the higher echelons of entertainment with no family or tribe connections you must work yourself up through the drug usesexual permissivenessprostitutionescort stages to things like mind control handlers and into darker levels of spiritual possession or soulloss at a profound level this sets the stage for the performer to become part of a very dark world artists who resist are a huge threat so the controllers compromise you in some way with evidence of your perversions or they threaten you or they finally kill you and if you are a big moneymaker you are often replaced and i don’t mean by another actor this way you or the num version of you can keep on making money for the dark side we are talking about losing one’s soul people and… it’s real you can be cloned cloning has been around for many decades we just are kept in the dark about it our former entertainer has many stories to relay of how famous celebrities changed in character and looks her suspicion is that they had been replaced she names such stars as michael jackson ann margaret joan baez jane fonda and jennifer connolly she had friends in the industry who knew these entertainers personally and believed they had indeed been replaced she also mentions bob dylan recently i saw an interview with dylan who was on num minutes and he admitted on camera that he had indeed made a deal with the devil long ago bob didn’t look happy replacement can be confusing to detect because many stars have plastic surgery with horrific results basic mutilation think mickey rourke or priscilla presley in their cases extreme surgeries could be used as a form of torture to fall in line or the actor performer is replaced the surgery takes place after the cloning to improve the original clones never live up to the originals they deteriorate rapidly there are many subtle differences however many actors will do anything to their bodies and minds to work in hollywood most are damaged people cautioning us to never idolize any star our insider says all successful actors stars celebs and so on have been heavily compromised in order to achieve their dream i mean after all show business is just a distraction in ancient rome the poet juvenal describing the political power scene of the day said panem et circenses bread and circuses meaning if you keep the masses fed and entertained they are less likely to kill or even notice their invisible handlers so it all boils down to the elite and the demonic force that is behind them she spoke of the madonnas who groom the younger women to eventually take their place with the sexualpsychic rituals she said that all these women are mind controlled and abused our insider states many celeb charity boards are fronts for prostitution sex trafficking and drugs many celebs are set up with boyfriends and marriages that are arranged the actresses agree to do porn in exchange for all the perks of being with a rich man but knowing they will lose it all if they break up with the guy human sacrifice snuff films are just human sacrifices these films are done when a sex slaveprostitutecall boy has gotten slightly haggard and past their sell by date or has pissed off the wrong people there is a huge market for these satanic sacrifice films among the exclusive connected and wealthy circles ie the demonic illuminati she also touches on the pregnant actresses who are suddenly not pregnant their babies are used for human sacrifice she claims bristol palin has been pregnant four times and three of the babies disappeared she was suddenly not pregnant you can read more about this here our actress believes there is a long list of famous people who have sacrificed a child including many political figures many mysterious accidents have happened to big name people and thereafter magically their career takes off now i know where the saying comes from whereby in signing a contract people joke about giving up their first born child for example george bush sr had two little girls that died ever heard of them remember barbara bush keeping a fetus in a jar i can attest to this phenomenon and i am very suspicious shortly after my beautiful young mother was killed in a horrific accident weeks after the death i was invited to washington dc by a us senator my father was his financial campaign manager i went to the home of george bush sr for a party holding poppy’s hand and chatting with barbara i remember being in total and complete shock and profoundly disassociated from my body at the time and for years afterward soon after this presidential visit my father’s career took off like gangbusters and we soon had oodles of money and a family jet and who was flying in that jet henry kissinger among many other elites pretty suspicious if you ask me a sacrifice i don’t know but it makes me want to go hmm… mm…mm…mammon kansas no more our informant ran into the dark arts very early on these dark arts are ruled by the illuminatireptiliannegative et’s negative humansmilitary industrial complex the negative gatekeepers need a certain number of true artists light worker types as camouflage sometimes these light types are targeted to move to a higher level on the playing field at the same time they are surrounded by relatively nice handlers who don’t corrupt them but the conclusion is that at some point everyone in the industry has to make the decision to yield to the corruption or get out that is if it’s not too late we are human batteries to them they pilfer our higher energy drugs alcohol and spiritual possession make it a much easier choice for the actorperformer to compromise i’ll do anything to get a job that is when the evil really steps in many of these people keep drugging and drinking to make their harrowing dark choice ok but many cannot keep up the illusion and want out at some point if they protest or tell the truth of what is really going on…they are often replaced they become surrounded by dark people dark organizations and dark nonhumans et’s or hybrids once this happens they barely have control over what happens next many victims of this satanic industry are those who have no family ties to speak of their lives are easier to erase and dispose of all planned all by design conclusion we the

was met with excitement mixed with a lot of anxiety would these be awful too would they be all ewoks and jar jar would the acting be so bad as to make you laugh in inappropriate parts so with some trepidation a generation of viewers bought tickets ahead of time to see episode vii and it was good maybe great maybe amazing but definitely all was good at the end there was clapping and rejoicing for the story but also for the sense that the movie makers disney now not george lucas heard the fans understood what was so genredefining and gamechanging about episode iii gave the fans the story without muppets and bad actors if the original movie resonated with the audience’s priors about good and evil the latest installment resonates with the audience’s need to be understood and heard george lucas has criticized the retro episode vii for pandering to the fans whatever i loved it i walked out and wanted to walk right back in again if you’ve seen the movie then you can track episode vii and episode iii and have already realized they are the same awesome movie there is a bad guy who used to be a good guy kylo ren and a bad guy mentor supreme leader snoke who are trying to take over the galaxy under the name the first order there is a resistance leader who has secret information poe who gives it to a droid bbnum to deliver it to the resistance there are two young people who bump into bbnum′s mission rey and finn and each have their own reasons for following or wanting to leave both rey and finn have parts of luke and han solo rey is a scavenger and a tinkerer and a pilot like han but she obviously has a higher calling to the force like luke finn is moved by love like luke but also has selfpreservation tendencies like han but they are interesting in their own right finn is fnnum a stormtrooper these iconic troops that have been nameless and faceless to star wars fans now have a backstory finn was taken from his family by the first order and programmed to fight his programming seems to not have taken at all after his first battle finn decides to escape but needs a pilot to help him luckily for him poe is being held prisoner and is the best pilot in the resistance together they escape heading toward jakku to find bbnum and take the secret information back to the resistance after their ship is disabled finn wakes up on jakku where he meets up with rey who has befriended bbnum after stormtroopers come calling the three take off in the millennium falcon  to get the information to the resistance guess what the information is a map to where luke skywalker has been living in selfimposed exile so the story is set and the parallels to the original lead one to predict where the plot is going to go characters are related to one another someone dies in a way that inspires the newest jedi etc along the way we meet back up with han and chewbacca and even general nee princess leia there are many many moments of homage to the original and i ate them up with the rest of the audience there are lots of things to criticize of course the galaxy which has as many nonhumanoid beings as humanoid beings seems to be about num female and num nonwhite droids may be more slave than robot we rewatched the original three and even in those movies droids inconsistently feel pain fear torture or destruction and have feelings as many people have pointed out the best parts of the movie are unoriginal but i will watch it again and again rey is a much more interesting female character than princess leia and a less whiny jedi than luke don’t get me started about hayden christensen’s anakin anakin is such a bad jedi he makes finn look like a great stormtrooper finn seems also more threedimensional than han i’m very interested to see where the plot is going where is the plot going one of the star wars trailers has a voiceover by luke mark hamill saying the force is strong in my family my father has it i have it my sister has it and you have it this is a riff on the same speech luke gives leia in episode vi but with the last sentence added this speech is never given in episode vii in fact luke doesn’t speak in this episode so we assume that he will eventually give the speech to rey but how does rey have the force is she related to luke will the movies ever mention midichlorians again no to be continued   ', 'cnnmoney lays off biz

also about comments from the head of the nsa james clapper alleging that whatever is being carried out is legal webre just to put it very bluntly mr james clapper is lying because under the obama administration his use of section num of the legislation that is citing in which he is saying that any tangible item of anyone can be taken from financial records to any other records the actions that he is undertaking violate the first amendment of the us constitution of freedom of speech the fourth amendment of unreasonable search and seizure the fifth amendment against selfincrimination and the fourteenth amendment as applied to all of the states so this is an absolute legal falsehood and it goes along with the legal falsehood that the cia earlier has attempted to give to the obama drone program which likewise is a violation of the constitution with this step mr obama has in fact taken the title from george w bush and become the most lawless president in us history james clapper has alleged that this program is necessary to guard against terrorist attacks in fact all of the attacks that have occurred in us territory have been false flag operations starting with the false flag

following the path blazed by last centurys tyrants could american democracy be replaced with totalitarian rule theres enough resemblance that yale historian timothy snyder who studies fascist and communist regime change and totalitarian rule has written a book warning about the threat and offering lessons for resistance and survival the author of on tyranny twenty lessons from the twentieth century talked to alternets steven rosenfeld steven rosenfeld three weeks ago you said that the country has perhaps a year to defend american democracy you said what happens in the next few weeks is crucial are you more concerned than ever that our political culture and institutions are evolving toward fascism resembling key aspects of the early 20thcentury european regimes you’ve studied timothy snyder let me answer you in three parts the first thing is that the num lessons that i wrote i wrote on november 15th the book on tyranny was done by christmas which means if people read it now and people are reading it and its describing the world they are in that means i’ve successfully made predictions based on history we’re going to talk about what is going to come but i want to point out that timeline—it was basically completely blind but the book does describe what is going on now the year figure is there because we have to recognize that things move fast nazi germany took about a year hungary took about two and a half years poland got rid of the toplevel judiciary within a year it’s a rough historical guess but the point is because there is an outside limit you therefore have to act now you have to get started early it’s just very practical advice it’s the metaadvice of the past that things slip out of reach for you psychologically very quickly and then legally almost as quickly it’s hard for people to act when they feel other people won’t act it’s hard for people to act when they feel like they have to break the law to do so so it is important to get out in front before people face those psychological and legal barriers am i more worried now i realize that was your question no i’m exactly as worried as i was before in november i think that the people who inhabit the white house inhabit a different ideological world in which they would like for the united states not to be the constitutional system that it now is i was concerned about that in november i’m concerned about it now nothing that has happened since has changed the way i see things sr let’s talk about how this evolution takes place you’ve written about how posttruth is prefascism you talk about leaders ignoring facts law and history how far along this progression are we i’m wondering where you might see things going next ts that’s tough because what history does is give you a whole bunch of cases where democratic republics become authoritarian regimes sometimes fascist regimes sometimes communist regimes it doesn’t give you one storyline a b c d it gives you a bunch of clusters of a and a bunch of clusters of c but factuality is really important and more important than people realize because it’s the substructure of regime change we think about democracy and that’s the word that americans love to use democracy and that’s how we characterize our system but if democracy just means going to vote it’s pretty meaningless russia has democracy in that sense most authoritarian regimes have democracy in that sense nazi germany had democracy in that sense even after the system had fundamentally changed democracy only has substance if there’s the rule of law that is if people believe that the votes are going to be counted and they are counted if they believe that there’s a judiciary out there that will make sense of things if there’s some challenge if there isn’t rule of law people will be afraid to vote the way they want to vote theyll vote for their own safety as opposed to their convictions so the thing we call democracy depends on the rule of law and the things we call the rule of law depends upon trust law functions num percent of the time automatically it functions because we think it’s out there and that in turn depends on the sense of truth so there’s a mechanism here you can get right to heart of the matter if you can convince people that there is no truth which is why the stuff that we characterize as postmodern and might dismiss is actually really really essential the second thing about posttruth is prefascism is i’m trying to get people’s attention because that is actually how fascism works fascism says disregard the evidence of your senses disregard observation embolden deeds that can’t be proven don’t have faith in god but have faith in leaders take part in collective myth of an organic national unity and so forth fascism was precisely about setting the whole enlightenment aside and then selling what sort of myths emerged now those national myths are pretty unpredictable and contingent on different nations and different leaders and so on but to just set facts aside is actually the fastest catalyst so that part concerns me a lot where we’re going the classic thing to watch out for is the shift from one governing strategy to another in the us system the typical governing strategy is you more or less have to follow your constituents with legislation because of the election cycle that’s one pulse of politics the other pulse of politics is emergency there’s some kind of terrorist attack and then the leader tries to suspend basic constitutional rights and then we get on a different rhythm where the rhythm is not one electoral cycle to the next but one emergency to the next that’s how regime changes take place it’s a classic way since the reichstag fire when the nazis burned their nation’s capitol building and blamed communist arsonists so in terms of what might happen next or what people could look out for some kind of event that the government claims is a terrorist incident would be something to be prepared for that’s why it’s one of the lessons in the book sr you have talked before about that kind of emergency justification—and even with vladimir putin in russia is that what you think would happen here because with the exception of the judiciary a lot of american institutions like congress are not really resisting they’re going along ts they’re going along… but my own intuition would be the emergency situation arises because going along isn’t going to be enough paradoxically congress is going along and is going to pass a bunch of stuff which is not actually very popular right it’s not going to be so popular to have millions of people lose health insurance which is what’s going to happen the ironic things about the republican congress is now it has the ability to do everything it wants to do but none of what it wants to do is that popular except with the few big lobbies of course the freedom the republicans have is the freedom to impose their agenda on down the same thing goes with mr trump the things that he might do that some people would like like building a wall or driving all the immigrants out those things are going to be difficult or slow in the case of the wall i personally don’t believe it will ever happen it’s going to be very slow so my suspicion is that it is much easier to have a dramatic negative event than have a dramatic positive event that is one of the reasons i am concerned about the reichstag fire scenario the other reason is that we are being mentally prepared for it by all the talk about terrorism and by the muslim ban very often when leaders repeat things over and over they are preparing you for when that meme actually emerges in reality sr i want to change the topic slightly you cite many examples from germany in num the year hitler consolidated power so what did ordinary germans miss that’s relevant for ordinary americans now i know some of this is the blurring of facts but when i have talked to holocaust survivors they often say nobody ever thought things would be that bad or nobody thought the germans would go as far as they did ts the german jews then and people now don’t understand how quick their neighbors will change don’t understand how quickly society can change they don’t understand the fact that a life that’s been predictable for a long time doesn’t mean that it will be predictable tomorrow and people like to think that their experience is exceptional german jews might have thought well there were pogroms ethnic cleansing in russia but surely nothing like that could happen here that’s what many german jews thought so one issue is people need to realize how quickly things can change the second thing that german jews were not aware of or germans were not aware of was how new media can quickly change conversations in that way it’s not exactly the same but radio at that time often ended up being a channel for propaganda there are parallels with the internet now where there were hopes that it would be primarily enlightening but in fact it turns out that with presidential tweets or with bots or isolated habits of viewing it isn’t necessarily enlightening it’s the opposite a lot of us were blindsided by the internet in much the same way that people could be blindsided by radio in dates but here’s the other view the one that we have that german jews didn’t have in num is we have their experience that’s the premise of the whole book the premise is that the 20th century showed us what can happen and there’s lots of wonderful scholarship by german historians and others which breaks down what can happen and how and so one of the first things that we should be doing is taking advantage of the one opportunity that we really have that they didn’t which is to learn from that history and that’s the premise of the book sr all of your book’s lessons are very personal don’t obey in advance believe in truth stand out defend institutions be calm but as courageous as you can be yet the change or oppression that you are talking about is systemic and institutional what do you say to people who say i’ll try but i may not have the power here there’s that cliche tilting at windmills  ts well if everyone tilted against a windmill the windmill would fall down right party of the tragedy of don quixote is he’s tilting against the wrong thing so that’s not our problem we’re pretty sure what the problem is but he was also alone except for his faithful companion we’re not really alone there are millions and millions of people who are looking for that thing to do just by sheer math if everyone does a little thing it will make a difference and much of what i am recommending is—you’re right they are things that people can do but they also involve some kind of engagement whether it’s the small talk with those you disagree with or whether it’s the corporeal politics and that little bit of engagement helps you realize that what you are doing has a kind of sense even if it doesn’t immediately change the order and finally a lot of the political theory that i am calling upon which comes from the antinazis and the anticommunists makes the point that even though you don’t realize it your own example matters a whole lot whether it’s positively or negatively there are times and this is one of those times where small gestures or their absence can make a huge difference so the things that might not have mattered a year ago do matter now the basic thing is we are making a difference whether we realize it or not and the basic question is whether it is positive or negative let me put it a different way except for really dramatic moments most of the time authoritarianism depends on some kind of cycle involving a popular consent of some form it really does matter how we behave the danger is if we say well we don’t see how it matters and so therefore we are going to just table the whole question if we do that then we start to slide along and start doing the things that the authorities expect of us which is why lesson number one is don’t obey in advance you have to set the table differently you have to say this is a situation in which i need to think for myself about all of the things that i am going to do and not just punt not just wait nor just see how things seems to me because if you do that then you change and you actually become part of the regime change toward authoritarianism sr you cite in the book something i read in high school eugene ionesco’s existential play about fascism rhinoceros where people talk about their colleagues at work in academia saying stuff like come on i don’t agree with everything but give him a chance ionesco’s point is that people join an unthinking herd before they know it what would you suggest people do when they run into others who fall on this spectrum ts there are a few questions here one is how to keep yourself going another is how to energize other people who agree with you and the third thing is not quite rhinoceros stuff but how to catch people who are slipping like that cnn coverage last week of the speech to congress where one of the cnn commentators said oh now this is presidential that was a rhinoceros moment because there was nothing presidential—it was atrocious to parade the victims of crimes committed by one ethnicity that was atrocious and there’s nothing presidential about it catching rhinoceros moments is one thing i think it’s really important to think about the example that ionesco gives is people saying yeah on one hand with the jews maybe they are right with trump people will say something like yeah but on taxes maybe he’s right and the thing to catch is yeah but are you in favor of regime change are you in favor of the end of the american way of democracy and fair play because that’s what’s really at stake with people all the way over at the end of the spectrum who are now confident about trump—that’s a different subject i think it’s important to maintain impossible human relations across that divide because some of those people are going to change their minds it’s harsh but some will change their minds and if they have no one to talk to it will be much harder for them to change their minds at different points on the spectrum you have to think in different ways my own major concern right now is with selfconfidence and the energy of the people who do have the deep—and i think incorrect—conviction that something has gone wildly wrong sr the people who have the conviction that something has gone wildly wrong—that can describe trump supporters and trump opponents ts that’s a good point so much of this is personal in the book i don’t actually mention anybody’s name except the thinkers who i admire so much of this is personal that people think well if you say anything critical it is about you as a person and how you don’t like anything about someone who likes trump that’s a way for there to be no political discussion i think it’s useful even though you will never win the argument when you are talking about people who support to the administration to stay at the level of the constitution to stay at the level of freedom or stay at the level of basic issues like is global warming really going to be so great when the entire pentagon says that it is a national security threat or is it really such a good idea to treat muslims like this or is it really going to be so good when millions of people lose health insurance keep it at the level of issues as much as possible because what i’ve found is the pattern that people shift to is why are you going to be so hard on this guy give him a chance but the issues of what’s constitutional what is actually american and what’s going to be a policy that they are going to be proud of a year from now—keep the conversation closest to the constitution it’s easiest to be dismissed when it’s personal and fundamentally this is the trick it isn’t personal it doesn’t matter who’s in charge what matters is the system which people of very different convictions take for granted is now under threat sr you have said that the muslims are being targeted as the jews were targeted in germany but out here in california it also feels like the deportation machinery is getting ready for undocumented immigrants on monday reuters reported that homeland security officials said they might separate mothers from kids when making arrests germany did that as it rounded up jews don’t they face just as grave a threat ts with the muslims the resemblance to antisemitic policy in germany in ’num is that if you can pick some group and make them stand in for some international threat then you can change domestic politics because domestic politics then is no longer about compromises and competing interests domestic politics is about who inside the society should actually be seen and outside the society once you get the wedge in with the first group them you essentially win it could be the muslims it could be somebody else is the point the political logic is basically the same with undocumented immigrants i think the logic might be a little bit different i think the goal might be to get us used to seeing a certain kind of police power and getting us used to seeing things happening to people in public and then if we get used to that then we might be more willing for the dial to turn a little bit further it’s too soon for me to speculate confidently about all of this i think you’re right though it could be the muslims but it doesn’t have to be the muslims the crucial thing is to get some kind of in political opening where people go along with or accept stigmatization and the logic is there’s always some kind of threat that comes from beyond the country and that we can fix that threat on a group of people inside the country and if you go along with this what else are you agreeing to go along with sr to go back to your book what you’re saying is that people should be vigilant should know their values and participate at some level with making those values known because that is what ordinary people can do ts yes the point of the book is that we are facing a real crisis and a real moment of choice the possibilities are much darker than americans are used to considering but at the same time what we can do is much more important than we realize the regime will only change if the gamble of the people in the white house is right that many of us despise many others of us and that most of us are indifferent if it turns out that there are emotions and values that are more numerous and more vibrant than indifference and hatred things are going to be okay that depends on us that depends on us making certain realizations it depends on us acting fast in that sense it’s a test not just collectively maybe there’s no such thing as a collective test but it is a test for us individually most americans who haven’t been abroad havent been faced by something like this and hopefully they won’t be faced with it again but we are faced with it as citizens and as individuals and i think five or num years from now no matter how things turn out we’ll ask ourselves—or our children will ask us—how we behaved in num', 'in our modern world it is very common for people to reach for manmade medicine as soon as they have a complaint about something this medicine may be

headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next this article was written by tyler durden and originally published at zero hedge editor’s comment the eu is now asserting its authority as an instrument of stability and telling member states to fall in line lest more severe consequences should arise  namely war does this amount to a threat or do eu bureaucrats merely mean to indicate that only through a centralized authority with diminished states rights can they avoid war europe may face disintegration anyway its currency crises and migration woes are causing instability and its caughtinthemiddle position complicates its relationships with the east and west nevertheless the drums of war are beating all across the globe and influence over europe and the middle east have become region blocs for conquest the original formations of the eu were built through an atlantic network including the secretive bilderberg group as an extension of the postwar pax americana eu commissioner’s dire warning the only alternative to europe is war by tyler durden while the saying goes good fences make good neighbors it appears the leadership of the eu is starting to get frustrated with the lack of acquiescence among some of the ‘union’s’ newer or more marginal members in a somewhat stunning statement following ongoing and contentious meetings to discuss solutions to the migrant ‘problem’ eu commissioner timmermanns appeared to warn disagreeable member states there is an alternative to everything i believe in eu cooperation because of all other forms in history have been tried to help europeans get on better and with the exception of this one all other forms have led to war  so let’s stick to this one as elsevier reports via google translate european leaders read the last few days the alarm about the survival of the european union eu prague said commissioner frans timmermans pvda friday that the eu is only one alternative war the only alternative to the eu is war said timmermans friday gave a speech at a conference in prague said a reporter for the times of london who attended the speech timmermans is the way europe responds to the migration crisis’ the biggest threat to the eu ever the commissioner underlined that countries should cooperate better when it comes to border controls migration is part of life but we must lead these movements together in the right direction said timmermans matching words timmermans in the alarmist tone that european leaders were heard in recent days about the survival of the eu earlier this week timmermans at the house of europe lecture in amsterdam that he fears for the survival of the eu i do not optimistic about doing that because i’m just not this is the first time in my conscious experience of european cooperation that i think it could ever really be able beaches luxembourg foreign minister who will chair the council of the european union on behalf of his country spoke in an interview about identical words the current migration crisis is the european ideal of free movement shaking on its foundations eu president donald tusk said that the eu is engaged in a race against the clock but we are determined to win this race said tusk as i warned earlier the only way not to dismantle the schengen ensure proper management of the external borders of the eu the eu appears to be unable to curb migration flows because the borders are not guarded seeing more and more countries are forced to protect their own borders even the welcoming sweden went on thursday to intensive checks on the southern border remember when hank paulson waved the mutual assured destruction card in the face of the us with his infamous blank check three page term sheet now it’s europe’s turn what’s worse

headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next this article was originally published by michael snyder at his economic collapse blog editor’s note it was always just a matter of time since the whole european fiasco was merely patched over after the last round all the new powers given to the european banks and all the king’s horses and men couldn’t put it back together again and couldn’t stop what was inevitable under the existing conditions  greece has been a ticking time bomb and things closer to disaster than ever everyone already knows how bad things stand to become if it plays out at its worst so get ready a grexit may be in the near future a brexit is still very possible and another round of global financial titanic could be in the works time will tell… the next great european financial crisis has begun the greek financial system is in the process of totally imploding and the rest of europe will soon follow neither the greeks nor the germans are willing to give in and that means that there is very little chance that a debt deal is going to happen by the end of june so that means that we will likely see a major greek debt default and potentially even a greek exit from the eurozone at this point credit default swaps on greek debt have risen num percent in price since the beginning of this year and the market has priced in a num percent chance that a greek debt default will happen over the past month the yield on two year greek bonds has skyrocketed from num percent to more than num percent and the greek stock market has fallen by a total of num percent during the last three trading days alone this is what a financial collapse looks like and if greece does leave the euro we are going to see this kind of carnage happen all over europe officials over in europe are now openly speaking of the need to prepare for a state of emergency now that negotiations have totally collapsed at one time it would have been unthinkable for greece to leave the euro but now it appears that this is precisely what will happen unless a miracle happens… greece is heading for a state of emergency and an exit from the euro following the collapse of talks to agree a bailout deal senior eu officials warned last night europe must be prepared to step in otherwise greek society would face an unprecedented crisis with power blackouts medicine shortages and no money to pay for police they said in the past the greeks have always buckled under pressure but this new greek government was elected with a mandate to end austerity and so far they have shown a remarkable amount of resolve in order for a debt deal to happen one side is going to have to blink and at this point it does not look like it will be the greeks… the world’s financial markets are facing up to the possibility that greece could soon become the first country to crash out of europe’s single currency talks between athens and its eurozone creditors have collapsed in acrimony just days before a final deadline for greece to unlock the €num2bn £num2bn in bailout funds it needs to avoid a catastrophic debt default the greek prime minister alexis tsipras accused the creditor powers of hidden political motives in their demands that greece make further cuts to public pension payments in return for the financial aid we are shouldering the dignity of our people as well as the hopes of the people of europe mr tsipras said in a defiant statement we cannot ignore this responsibility this is not a matter of ideological stubbornness this is about democracy as we approach the point of no return both sides are preparing for the endgame in greece members of parliament have been studying what happened in iceland a few years ago many of them believe that a greek debt default combined with a nationalization of greek banks and a greek exit from the euro could set the nation back on the path to prosperity fairly rapidly the following comes from the telegraph… the radical wing of greece’s syriza party is to table plans over coming days for an icelandicstyle default and a nationalisation of the greek banking system deeming it pointless to continue talks with europe’s creditor powers syriza sources say measures being drafted include capital controls and the establishment of a sovereign central bank able to stand behind a new financial system while some form of dual currency might be possible in theory such a structure would be incompatible with euro membership and would imply a rapid return to the drachma the confidential plans were circulating over the weekend and have the backing of num mps from the aristeri platforma or ‘left platform’ as well as other hardline groupings in syriza’s spectrum it is understood that the nationalist anel party in the ruling coalition is also willing to force a rupture with creditors if need be meanwhile in a desperate attempt to get the greeks to give in at the last moment greek’s creditors are preparing to pull out all the stops in order to put as much financial pressure on greece as possible… germany’s suddeutsche zeitung reported that the creditors are drawing an ultimatum to the greeks threatening to cut off greek access to the european payments system and forcing capital controls on the country as soon as this weekend the plan would lead to the temporary closure of the banks followed by a rationing of cash withdrawals for a long time most in the financial world assumed that a debt deal would eventually happen but now reality is setting in as i mentioned at the top of this article the cost to insure greek debt has risen by an astounding num percent since the beginning of this year… given these dramatic stakes the risk of a greek default has gone way up one way to measure that risk is by looking at the skyrocketing price of insurance policies that would pay out if greek bonds go bust the cost to insure greek debt for one year against the risk of default has skyrocketed num since the start of date according to factset data these insurancelike contracts known as credit default swaps imply there is a num to num probability of greece defaulting on its debt according to jigar patel a credit strategist at barclays the probability of a greek default soars to a whopping num for fiveyear cds patel said default is looking more and more likely peter boockvar chief market analyst at the lindsey group wrote in a note to clients on tuesday and in recent days we have also seen greek stocks and greek bonds totally crash the following comes from cnn… the greek stock market has plummeted num over the past three trading days including a num drop on tuesday alone in the bond market the yield on greek twoyear debt has skyrocketed to num a month ago the yield was only num yields rise as bond prices fall of course if there is a greek debt default and greece does leave the euro it won’t just be greece that pays the price as i have written about previously there are tens of trillions of dollars in derivatives that are directly tied to currency exchange rates and num trillion dollars in derivatives that are directly tied to interest rates a grexit would cause the euro to drop like a rock and interest rates all over the continent would start to go crazy the financial chaos that a grexit would cause should not be underestimated and there are signs that some of europe’s biggest banks are already on the verge of collapse for example just consider what has been going on at the biggest bank in germany both of the coceos at deutsche bank

opioid craze and one of the most addictivewrites that a recent expose by theuncovered the fact that purdue pharma knowingly lied about their product despite being marketed as a numhour pill the handiwork revealed that purdue \"knew the claim was a lie as did its sales reps patients medical professional and even regulatory authorities at best oxy only provided eight hours of pain relief \"this means that patients were exposed to withdrawal symptoms received inadequate care and were often pushed up to a higher dose of oxycontin  which puts patients at increased risk of death however higher dosages make more money than more frequent doses so this was a very clever and malevolent  marketing choice by purdueyou can see where this is the kind of company that caresabout public wellbeing and quite a lot about profits it is not surprising that purdue pharma and others like them have spent nearly a billion dollars trying to protect their hold on the american people betdate date big pharma spent nearly num times more fighting opioid restrictions than opioid restriction advocates spent in the same time period sadly it is not just big pharma pushing their agenda even organizations that many people consider to be \"respectable\" have dipped their toes in the pond the american cancer society for example has reportedly teamed up with the pharmaceutical industryopioids are very similar to heroin only they can be prescribed to patients as pain relievers due to their highly addictive nature it is no surprise that the industry desperately wants to protect their ability to be prescribed to anyone for just about anything opioids are a cash cowdr andrew kolodny a tremendous supporter of prescription opioid reform told the \"they are reaping enormous profits from aggressive prescribing\" and while they benefit millions sufferover num million americans reportedly suffer with an addiction to opioid drugs just shy of a halfmillion people suffer with heroin addiction as well the national institute on drug abuse reports that roughly num percent of all heroin users report that their addiction began with misusing opioid drugs  being that prescription opioids are rather expensive it is no surprise that people eventually move on to less expensive options this figure shows that it is not just people currently using prescription opioids that are being harmed by these drugs but many others as well one could even postulate that a significant portion of heroin overdoses could be traced back to opioids in addition to the thousands of deaths caused by opioids directly some estimates indicate that opioids are related to up to num deaths each day spending num million on protecting their profits instead of supporting legislation that would help to end the opioid epidemic ensured that their priorities would be easily understood despite the claims of big pharma companies like purdue that they actually care about addiction and the people affected by it it has becomeclear that thethey care about is the fact that it makes them money', 'cancer causes  of readers think this story is fact add your two cents headline bitcoin

can be found here i’m doing the best i can source url', 'by giovani  liveanddarecom are you truly happy is happiness a passing feeling or a state of being for you tons of articles and books have been written about how to be happy and there is some good information out there i have read and synthesised hundreds of hours of research and experiments here for you in this actiondriven article what you will find is some deep lifechanging stuff if you think that all talk about how to be happy is fluffy material and common sense you are in it for a change there is a theory in psychology called the hedonic treadmill which says that great events like winning a lottery and terrible events like losing a leg can happen in your life but after a while you are always back to your baseline happiness if that is true then more important than trying to change your external life is to actually improve your baseline happiness this is the focus of this article  and not feel happy strategies each item here is concluded with a suggested action step and at the end of the post you will find a link to download a pdf with all of them  understanding what authentic happiness is is happiness a feeling or a state of being what is its nature and what are its causes wikipedia defines happiness as a mental or emotional state of wellbeing characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy there can never be any objective measurement of happiness based on external achievements it is an interpretation of reality and not a result of reality actually happiness is such a loaded term that i wonder if it is the right one for what we are truly seeking i personally prefer to speak of fulfillment contentment and wellbeing the greeks on the other hand spoke of eudamonia the welllived life the problem seems to be understanding what causes human beings to continually experience this state my research and selfexperiments have led me to believe that there are three kinds of happiness personal transpersonal and transcendental personal happiness most people live by the belief that happiness is simply the result of accumulating as many pleasurable moments as possible and of fulfilling one’s desires money possessions food fun sex fame power here is both the trap of living as if there is no tomorrow the hedonistic blind focus in the present and living in hope of a better tomorrow putting off happiness to the achievement of a future goal the problem with this is that the pursuit of these pleasures and achievements can often be a painful and frustrating process that is an unhappy process besides the happyfeeling resulting from these achievements is shortlived and usually less glorious than the promise see havard psychologist daniel gilbert on miswanting  on top of that in many cases we must fight hard to keep what was gained finally even if we are those rare beings that can always easily get and keep what we want without much pain associated with it the inevitable result after a while is boredom and indifference not really the definition of a fulfilled life right sounds more like an ocean of trouble with some islands of happy feelings the verbs for personal happiness are to get to feel to achieve transpersonal happiness scientific research in the field of positive psychology pioneered by dr martin seligman phd proposes that a higher zone of happiness is to use one’s unique qualities and perspective in the service of something larger than oneself this higher cause can revolve around family community science art world reform spiritual transformation etchere happiness is more of a process a continuum a path rather than an event and because its cause is larger than one’s ego so is the resulting joy have a look at the perma model of happiness to learn more the verbs for transpersonal happiness are to do to grow to impact transcendental happiness a more uncommon view of happiness proposed by many eastern traditions is that it is our natural state of being our true self if it is natural to us why then is it not experience always just like health is inherent to our body but is disturbed by bad habits and bad food happiness is inherent to our heart but disturbed by negative mindsets the verbs for transcendental happiness are to be to discover to transform these three kinds are not selfexcluding each one has its place and you can have it all ready to explore what are the causes of true wellbeing and lasting satisfaction in life let’s do this part num  the essential num discover your true values the single most important element in living a fulfilling life is understanding your true personal values and aligning you existence to them by values i don’t mean personal qualities like honesty and integrity  i mean those activities  goals that most consume your soul it is what you are hungry for those things that you love to think about read about talk about learn about examples of values family building your career athletic performance art spirituality travelling being a thought leader developing your business etc it’s more of a doing not a having how to discover your values take some minutes to look deeper into yourself and your life and it will tell you where you naturally focus your valuable resources time energy money attention actually take the time to do this here are some guiding questions how do you spend your free time how do you spend your money what in your life are you most reliable disciplined and focused what do you most think about and dream about what do you love to learn read about and explore what inspires you the most fast forward your life num years and look back you are proud of achieving one thing what is that the elements that appear repeatedly are your core values it is here that you will find your passion your direction they are your map for every single decision in your life your map for a happy life this is such a deep topic that it deserves a post of itself and probably will get for now to learn more about core values i highly recommend the book the breakthrough experience by dr john f demartini an expert in this field action step give yourself numnum minutes to contemplate on those questions and discover your core numnum values if you are busy now put in some time in your calendar for later  num how to be happy align your life to your values your happiness is where your values are it is what we want to do what makes us alive the more your daily thoughts and activities are in harmony with your values the happier you are this is also one of the power tool of coaches now put your values in order with the most important ones on top and examine how much juice they are getting in the different aspects of your life how much money time and energy are you spending on them are they actively directing your life your daily choices or are they being suffocated and forgotten in the maze of the practicalities of living and other less important things how can your authentic self be more in the steering wheel of your life action step understand how much your core values are directing your life or not commit to making num simple changes to increase their power num leave aside the unessential  the art of saying no are you feeling overwhelmed with tasks maybe lacking headspace or direction in life then you might have said yes to many things that are not truly essential or not in harmony with your personal values therefore there is no space to move or not enough energy to build what is really meaningful for you that extra project you took the extra credit card the relationship you are keeping and you don’t really care about the stuff you bought and don’t really need the old habits that are lurking around but have no meaning anymore when making decisions every yes is a commitment to something and a closure to other things it is allowing something  an activity a place a person a task  to occupy valuable resources in your life you can produce more money but the time spent on something or someone will never come back saying yes to anything also demands our commitment of energy and headspace an increasingly rare commodity these days the inability to say no is actually rooted in fear fear of missing out an opportunity fear of closing a door that we can never again reopen but we simply cannot have it all and we fail to see that this fear is actually the very cause that makes us close many other doors to explore more on this check out dan ariely’s classic predictably irrational is this thing i`m thinking of saying ‘yes’ to gonna supporting my core values or not how is this decision affect my present and future self answering these questions from moment to moment is the human journey in simple terms our life impact and wellbeing is determined by what we say yes to it is a collective of yeses and nos no is not a negative word it is not aggressive it is not rejection it is not selfish it is focus no is a powerful word and can be used powerfully all geniuses of humanity  in art sport politics literature science  were saying yes to a few things and no to everything else they were not chasing the next shining object i don’t know the key to success but the key to failure is trying to please everybody bill cosbynum the contemplation of our finite nature of limitation of death pushes human beings to accomplish extraordinary things to live amazing lives that is why many people that go through neardeath experiences have their life transformed for the better they stop saying yes to things that don’t really matter to them and start focusing on what is really important that is why the movement of minimalism is gaining traction in modern society for more on this topic i recommend joshua becker’s blog becoming minimalist and this ted talk the foundation of a happy life therefore is to discover our core values align our life and actions to them and religiously say no to all the needless things that are not in service trust your heart and your gut if you feel that a person or activity is simply not for you action step write down num things you want to start saying no to in life take note of what you are losing time energy money head space by allowing those things to creep in num act based on creative freedom  not conditioning since birth we have been exposed to so much conditioning  from our family friends society media environment and still continue to be bombarded by thousands of messages every day these outside voices have been heard and repeated so many times that they start having an independent life inside of us no wonder it is hard to find our true voice as opposed to the voice of other people’s opinions yet we only find fulfilment and freedom by following our own unique voice  our personal legend as paulo coelho would have it so what to do the key is to discover what our core values are this process can take time to mature in us taking some time alone apart from all that is familiar from us can help meditation travel  retreats can give us the space to discover ourselves a life coach can also be of service according to australian nurse bronnie ware who spent many years working with patients on their last weeks of life the top regret of the dying is i wish i’d had the courage to live a life true to myself not the life others expected of me your values will be your rule of thumb when deciding what is your voice and what is conditioning action step next time you feel unsure what path to take use your core values to discern your true path from your conditioning be determined to act based on your higher good and not based on what you believe you should do num live the present but don’t hunt the shortterm being exclusively presentoriented or future oriented are both points of unbalance to be in the trap that i`ll be happy when… is a cause of unhappiness to be missing or sacrificing the present  the beautiful nature the human relations the rest needed the peace and joy of being here and breath  is a cause of unhappiness believing happiness to be in the future is not only a risky assumption but also betrays the concept of happiness as a state of being it is not in the achievement of your goals  it is in the process of living your values but to live as if there is no tomorrow to focus only on shortterm goals is the other extreme of this scale and is not sustainable either in his classic book emotional intelligence daniel goleman describes an experiment in which fouryear old kids are left in a room alone and told they can have two marshmallows if they wait for the experimenter to return from an errand if they can’t wait till then they can have only one marshmallow but they can have it now some kids were able to hold off the fifteen to twenty minutes while others jumped on the one marshmallow  almost always within seconds years later the same kids were interviewed and goleman discovered that their ability to delay gratification revealed a great deal about the trajectory that child would likely take in their lives the scholar concluded that there is perhaps no psychological skill more fundamental than resisting impulse it is curious that many times our success in the shortterm is exactly the reason of our failure in the longterm living day by day with a higher direction in mind yet with our feet on the ground seems to be the balance point between present and future a balance between enjoying the now and designing the future action step take note of num things that you are sacrificing in your present for the promise of a better future then write down num places in your life where your focus on shortterm goals may be harming the longterm direction you want for your life you now know what tweaks you can make so you can be both more present and also focused on the right things num don’t chase extrinsic values while focus on extrinsic life values may lead to a quicker satisfaction of these desires true fulfilment will not be found down this path on the other hand there are countless testimonials of people that focused first on the important stuff in life and as a result also got the extrinsic goals met there is a lot of research in this sense phd professor ronald inglehart found that once middleclass comforts are in place the link between wealth and wellbeing is surprisingly weak indeed virtually negligible in his bestselling book on the science of motivationwhy we do what we do edward deci tells us the researchers found that if any of the three extrinsic aspirations  for money fame or beauty  was very high for an individual relative to the three intrinsic aspirations the individual was also more likely to display poorer mental health for example having an unusually strong aspiration for material success was associated with narcissism anxiety depression and poorer social functioning as rated by a trained clinical psychologist…in contrast strong aspirations for any of the intrinsic goals  meaningful relationships personal growth and community contributions  were positively associated with wellbeing people who strongly desired to contribute to their community for example had more vitality and higher selfesteem when people organize their behavior in terms of intrinsic strivings relative to extrinsic strivings they seem more content  they feel better about who they are and display more evidence of psychological health action step review your core values what is driving you in life are these extrinsic values or intrinsic values if they are extrinsic what is the bigger value behind them num be careful how you feed your senses our body is fed by food water and other elements our mind is fed through ideas and the five senses the quality of our mind and internal wellbeing is profoundly formed by the things we see listen to watch smell touch read think about etc how are you feeding your senses the music you choose to hear affects your moods depending on the genre it can make you inspired calm emotional or violent depressed confused the same goes with the movies we watch books we read and all other types of media environment food here and here and people action step make a list of the top five things that you are feeding your senses and do not serve your wellbeing reflect whether you really need these things in your life or not commit to one small change num find a place of flow flow is that beautiful state of total integration in your present activity you are there with your whole body mind and soul and its as if you disappear and there is nothing else in the world total concentration maybe it is when you are running or reading a great book or giving a speech or drawing perhaps when thinking deeply about some matter or when meditating different people access the flow according to their own passion it is what moves artists athletes writers and entrepreneurs to give their whole selves into their project it is also one of the cornerstones of the daoist philosophy mihaly csikszentmihalyi author of finding flow and one of the pioneers in this research wrote in all the activities people in our study reported engaging in enjoyment comes at a very specific point whenever the opportunities for action perceived by the individual are equal to his or her capabilities playing tennis for instance is not enjoyable if the two opponents are mismatched the less skilled player will feel anxious and the better player will feel bored the same is true for every other activity… enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety when the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act to expand on this topic check out this article on the blog pursuitofhappiness action step what are the activities in your life that you are more likely to find flow how can you deepen your involvement in these activities num nurture your spirituality several studies point out the relationship between spiritual development and personal wellbeing a num review of more than num studies of mainly adult populations found that out of those num studies num num found only positive associations between religiosityspirituality and wellbeing for some people spirituality come through their religion but spirituality and religion are different things you can be spiritual without being religious  that is without joining any religion or church spirituality does not require you do give your power away to some external person or institution nor to have blind faith it is not dogmatic nor ritualistic it is not a cult it does not limit your freedom and it does not make you close minded as a side note there studies that show benefits of meditation regardless of belief or religious inclination true spirituality is an invitation to look deeper into your life your values and discover your true self exploring this topic more indepth will be a subject of other posts for now you can start by reading some meditation quotes action step start looking for ways to develop your spirituality a deeper perspective and values in life num master your mind buddhism and other ancient traditions emphasise that our mind can be our greatest friend or our worst enemy it can make our life heaven or hell more than those who hate you more than all your enemies an undisciplined mind does greater harm  the buddha there is no doubt about this  there can be no happiness while we are enslaved by our own shadows no factor seems to be more important for our wellbeing than the state of our minds and yet for the average person up to num of ones thoughts is negative selftalk this leads to emotional overload and stress ok i get it i hear you say but how to control the mind thing is you cannot control the first thought that arises in the mind in any given situation  that is simply a conditioned response but you can exercise control over the second thought and the ones after here lies your power and responsibility for example i`m sitting in the couch in a sunday afternoon and the thought arises i`m lonely whether i accept this and continue on this train of thought yeah nobody loves me… etc or simply let it pass its my choice i can also choose to instead think yes i`m alone at this moment but its good i need some selfspace one way leads to anxiety victimization and selfpity  the other doesn’t thousands of times per day we make choices like this although most times it is automatic and we are not aware of it becoming aware of our mind processes and exercising our power to direct our attention is the mastery of the mind and this is greatly facilitated by practices such as meditation and mindfulness there are also techniques developed by psychologists the message here is that the way you feel the way you think is not a necessity it is merely a learned habit it is in great part arbitrary you have the power to change it you are giving power to your thoughts by thinking them by engaging in a conversation with them and believing them if they are creating suffering remember that you have the power to think something different the mind cannot hold on to two opposite feelings at the same time so focusing on developing positive thought patterns and emotions already goes a long way watch mathieu ricard exphd scientist turned monk expand on this action step become aware of your internal dialogs be vigilant of your negative thoughts next time negative thinking kicks in exercise your power to redirect your thoughts to something else to reinterpret the facts or to simply ignore in the beginning you will succeed only for a few seconds with practice and persistence however it becomes natural and easy part num  mindset  attitudes some mindsets empower a life of success and fulfilment others create difficulties and pain these can be learned by experience the hard way by reading good personal development material by engaging with mentors and life coaches or by reflection and meditation here are my findings from these learning paths num face everything as an opportunity to grow this is probably the most empowering attitude i’ve ever encountered it is a good medicine against many of the causes of fear frustration impatience anxiety and stress if you face every event every challenge as part of the way then nothing can disturb you you will not fear nor complain nor blame nor be pissed off by things that happen instead in your mind there will be only the question what can i learn from this an event doesn’t mean anything by itself it is always only what you make of it you have the power to make it positive or negative you get a no as an answer your car breaks it’s raining on a sunday again you can’t finish your project got sick nobody is buying your product your son doesn’t listen to you you can resist these things close yourself up fight them you now have a problem and that is unfortunate or you can be open breath deeply acknowledge what is there look for your lesson and for the next step you now simply have a new context and that is an opportunity performance psychologist john eliot author of the somewhat controversial overachievement has a very interesting expression eat stress like an energy bar yes even emotions like stress anger envy can be used for something positive as motivators for action depending on our attitude these energies can be empowering or disempowering life’s challenges are polishing you preparing you for bigger things action step next time a challenge comes kiss its face learn the lesson and move on num expectation creates disappointment expectation is wishful thinking about the future it sets a selfimposed standard of what is to happen a bit like drawing a line on the sand and deciding that if it is above this line i`ll be happy if not i`ll be upset some expectations are natural and not as harmful when i buy a product from the supermarket i expect it to not be rotten and will have an unpleasant surprise if it is other expectations however are just a recipe for disaster for instance expecting things to be easy when learning something or working on my business or trying to navigate through life will create a lot of frustration if instead i expect things to be hard i’ll be well prepared if they turn out to be easy i`m happy if they turn out to be hard… well no surprises here after all usually what is worth having doesn’t comes easy similarly hoping to get lucky to be accepted to have quick success to have no conflicts  all these expectations bring about pain we’d be better off just doing what we need to do and leaving the future to take care of itself while it may be impossible to live without any expectations at all when we learn to be more conservative and soft about our expectations we suffer less the consequences of their violation keeping in mind that they are arbitrary and selfimposed we tend to have more flexibility and flow manage your expectations and you will rarely be disappointed check out also the create posts about the subject on lifehacker huffington post and tiny buddha action step what needless expectations are you imposing on yourself right now do you really need them num yesterday is graveyard… how to forget the past and reinvent your history victimization remorse guilt regret no doubt these are unhappy feelings and they all have something in common they are anchored in the past what are you dwelling on your past failures a betrayal a gaffe you made on the last dinner party something unjust that happened to you the past is good for one thing only learning we need to reflect on what has happened learn from it and move on your past does not define you  unless you allow it to you are not what has happened to you you are what you choose to become you mind defines you and mind creates what it constantly thinks about suddenly over thinking the past doesn’t sound like a good idea anymore… it is usually pain and not pleasure that keeps us looking back the desire to correct the past is one of the main reasons why we get stuck in it and yet this desire goes against a basic law of nature if we reflect deeply about how this tendency is hurting our present how it is hindering our life here and now we will have the motivation needed to make a decision to let go and stop looking back of course if possible it also helps to get physically apart from places and people who take you back to your past another approach is to actually reinvent your past yes it is possible and it is not hallucination the fact is the past that we remember is what we have subjectively experienced not the raw facts it is the facts + our thinkingfeeling it is not reality but rather our colourful description of it  and we have the power to change this if somebody did something bad to us we cannot start believing that they simply didn’t do that we actually can but that’s delusional but we can change our belief about what that means to us and that basically changes everything because for the rest of our life we will remember our story of the event it’s ending and not the experience of the event morty lefkoe author of the bestseller recreate your life teaches a process that can be used to reinterpret past events in a simple way identify the undesirable pattern name the underlying belief identify the source of the belief in memory including as much sensory detail as possible describe possible alternate interpretations of the memory realize that your original belief is an interpretation not reality consciously choose to reject the original belief as false consciously choose to accept your reinterpretation as true both interpretations are valid your reality will be defined by the one you choose to accept your choice action step identify where in your past you usually get stuck in and go through the reinterpretation process num accept the things you cannot control or change whether we like it or not many things in life we cannot change we cannot change other people nor the behaviour of the market other things can be changed but only with colossal effort during a long period of time accepting reality is not a passive attitude it does not make us weak it does require humility of course but it empowers us to respond to life in a wiser more effective way we cannot fight all battles so let’s choose wisely what to accept and what to focus to change action step are you struggling to accept some major reality in yourself or your life what would happen if instead of asking how can i change this you asked how can i make use of this num move in the direction of your fears yes you read that right have this determination that no fear must arise unmet have this obsession that every fear must be confronted and conquered this unleashing of your inner hero will deepen your life and broaden your heart fear is one of the most instinctive human emotions it can take many forms such as worry fear about future circumstances doubt fear about making the wrong choice and hatred the aggressive response to the feared object most likely you will experience it your whole life so it might be a good idea to learn how to deal with it the problem is not that fear arises the problem if any is how you respond to it yes believe it or not you have total freedom as to how to respond maybe it is hard to experience it because you might not have exercised this mindmuscle much but it’s there experiencing danger  risk can be character building as well even for your kids a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor and skilled sailors have a depth in their live that novices don’t happy are those that are bigger than their fears and how to be bigger than your fear act bigger than your fear when in doubt close your eyes and take the leap don’t cling to something just because of fear it makes you a prisoner hey fear is not a big deal just some electrical impulses in your brain coupled with a bit of chemicals running through your blood will this keep you powerless while life runs you by action step think of something that makes you afraid take one small step every day in the direction of that fear it’s important that it be a small step otherwise you may lose motivation feel the confidence that comes from acting despite the fear gradually increase the boldness of your actions num embrace impermanence not understanding and accepting impermanence is a cause of unhappiness impermanence is the fundamental law of our existence this is the only thing that is certain in this life everything changes time eats away everything and nothing remains the same your time will be spent money will be gone many things that you cared about will either disappear or you will no longer care about them the good news is that whatever negative feeling or unpleasant situation you are experiencing will also pass there was a time when it did not exist then it shows up for a limited time and after that it goes back to not existing several ancient traditions emphasised the need to contemplate the fleeting nature of our lives from buddha to the stoics who called this exercise memento mori a deeper life opens up when we understand and embrace impermanence and our mortality and learn its lessons a deep and often unnoticed fear in our hearts is released once we accept impermanence down to our bones as a result we get more focused and we are freed up to live a more amazing life action step spend some time reflecting about how everything constantly changes think of something that you are very attached to or a situation that is bothering you realize that this too shall pass num happy thoughts  choosing optimism choosing happiness yes wellbeing and happiness is a matter of choice habits of thinking need not be forever one of the most significant findings in psychology in the last twenty years is that individuals can choose the way they think  martin seligman from learned optimism in this wonderful book the author explains the difference between optimism and the much in vogue positive thinking the former is learning a new set of cognitive skills while the later is repeating positive affirmations to yourself and the skills we need to learn is that of changing our explanatory styles which is how we chose to talk to ourselves when interpreting what’s happening the following experiment was made with two dogs the first dog is slightly shocked but has a lever he can push to stop the shocks he quickly learns to stop the shocks he’s in good psychological shape a second dog does not have a lever so he can’t stop the shocks his shocks stop only when the first dog hits his lever so in effect the shocks are random for him our second dog learns that he is helpless in the face of these shocks here’s what’s fascinating the dogs are then moved to a new area and taught a new way to avoid the shocks so now they can both avoid the shocks at will remarkably although the first dog avoids the shocks the second dog curls up in the corner and whimpers as the shock  which he could have avoided  is administered he has learned helplessness the second dog may feel sorry for himself he may blame the first dog he may complain all of these are disempowering or he may learn to see things differently we condition ourselves through our own selftalk and then become prisoners of our interpretations and blind to reality whether you tell yourself that you can or can’t you are right that is why if you want to create instant change in your life watching your selflanguage seems a great place to start how you describe your reality is how you define it how you create it here is the model the author proposes for an optimist explanatory style permanence  is what happened likely to continue optimists think that if it’s a bad thing it’s a fluke if it’s a good thing they tend to think it’s permanent the opposite holds true for the pessimist good things are the flukes and bad things are more likely to recur  is what happened likely to continue optimists think that if it’s a bad thing it’s a fluke if it’s a good thing they tend to think it’s permanent the opposite holds true for the pessimist good things are the flukes and bad things are more likely to recur pervasiveness  does it reflect your whole life is it universal or is it specific with a good event the optimist is more likely to extend it to her whole life with a bad event she will tend to isolate the incident as specific to that situation the opposite holds true for the pessimist  does it reflect your whole life is it universal or is it specific with a good event the optimist is more likely to extend it to her whole life with a bad event she will tend to isolate the incident as specific to that situation the opposite holds true for the pessimist personalisation  is it internal or external something good happens an optimist pats himself on the back internal thinking he did a good job if the same thing happens to a pessimist he is more likely to attribute the success to luck other people’s hard work or something else outside of his control external how we interpret events can maximise happiness and energize us or make us feel terrible and the good news is it’s in our power to decide it is an emotional intelligence skill that can be developed of course many situations in life call for a dose of pessimism caution and defensive thinking so our optimism should not blind us either like anything in excess irrational optimism is also harmful  though arguably less harmful than irrational pessimism so maybe this section should be called choosing balanced optimism true optimism is more a reaction to the present than an expectation about the future it is not about blindly believing that things will always turn out he best that violates the principle of managing your expectations see point num true optimism is about choosing to interpret events in a positive light when they do happen and not being attached to past negative talk it is being open that anything can happen yet at the same time confident that i can do something positive with anything that comes there are several studies on how being optimistic positively affects physical and mental health num num romantic relationships athletic performance career business and the economy check out this article to read more on optimism  positive psychology and this one about how happiness is also a deliberate choice action step identify three places in your life you are having negative selftalk how could you have a more empowering interpretation of that situation is the negative selftalk based on reality now or mere learned habit num be wrong needing to be right all the time can be extremely limiting and energy consuming having the courage to be vulnerable and accept one’s mistakes is liberating whether you accept it not reality is that many times you will be wrong by saying i was wrong more often  to yourself and others  you will find more compassion humility and flexibility people will trust you more it is good to always aim for the highest  as long as we understand that perfection is unattainable both in work and in relationships nothing is perfect even the earth is not perfectly round you will invariably make bad decisions understanding how often we are wrong makes us be more compassionate towards ourselves we see that many times we simply did the best we could at that time  we need is to educate ourselves not punish ourselves we will also tend to criticise others less and be more empathetic which will improve our social relations humility pays off personally it was not easy for me to accept and practice this lesson but once i tried a few times i started taking pleasure in it there is a certain unburdening of the heart that happens which makes it worth it even if only for that feeling my values and points of view were changing by time even to something opposite and i saw that contradicting myself was a sign of growth not confusion or unreliability action step is it hard for you to accept being wrong if so try this look back and see some opinion you had that you now see was wrong or maybe some bad decision then clearly express that you were wrong to a person involved in that situation depending on the magnitude of what happened this little act can save a relationship a company a life num have some trust one of the qualities of developing your spirituality is the trust on something larger than yourself call it god the universe dharma life  doesn’t matter it’s not about a whimsical expectation that things will happen according to your preference but a faith that things will happen in favor of your greater good it’s a conviction that if you put your best foot forward the universe will respond does one really need trust no but life is more beautiful with it trust in something larger accomplishes four important things makes you optimistic section num decreases your worries and doubts allowing you to forget about the future and focus more on the present forces you to accept things you cannot change takes you out of your little world you are less prone to mental masturbation of what if… there is also scientific evidence that trust makes us happy and here is a podcast episode where one of my guests speaks about the value of surrender action step is it time to take a leap of faith somewhere in your life how would your feelings and actions be different if you had more trust num dare to disagree it’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t marc and angel chernoff free yourself from the crowd mentality be a lion you will not find happiness in the life of a sheep  at most comfort the lion finds his own path or carves one out if none is found the sheep follows the beaten road the lion walks alone if needed and is fearless the sheep is fearful and moves in herds the lion roars loud and clear the sheep’s sound is weak and hesitant the lion rests deep confident he can handle any challenge the sheep is worried about tomorrow the lion makes the news the sheep reads the news the lion creates and innovates the sheep follows standards and repeats patterns the lion will fight even though wounded the sheep will run even before a fight be a light unto yourself as the buddha said sing your own song the world needs your unique gift presence perspective no need to apologise for your existence and your dreams action step are you being a sheep in any place in your life awaken the lion within num money matters but not really what can money do for you and how much of it do you really need it’s a huge topic but for the purposes of this post we can say there are broadly three types of attitudes when it comes to money it’s not important and other limiting beliefs it’s extremely important and the reason of my efforts money is a resource and its important for my life but it’s not a measure of success or happiness the first two will make you make you suffer the balanced point of view will set you in the right path there is plenty of research concluding that money does matter but that once a certain threshold of comfort is achieved some studies suggest num70k a year it matters less and less to the overall wellbeing of the person after the basic needs of life of oneself and one’s family are met to continue to chase money is more a cause of dissatisfaction than fulfillment refer to point number num of this post especially if driven by peer comparison pressure and consumerism the most valuable thing money can buy is time and it is how you use your time that will determine how happy you are once the point of comfort has been reached feeling happy with what we have and focusing our efforts on life’s intrinsic values seems to be the best use of money also experiments show that spending it on others can boost our happiness more than spending it on ourselves see also greatergood and sciencemag action step discover what is your attitude about money are you holding any limiting beliefs or overfocused on accumulating wealth num do your inner work all of these insights have one thing in common they require some inner work these keys are worthless unless you actually use them you will need to put in some thought about yourself and your life develop more selfawareness and then decide to make a change most people are not taking this path  they are simply looking for patches solve one problem at its root and you will never need to solve it again if you keep coming back to the same problems on the same level then maybe something is not right no shortcuts here no silver bullet just the pains of personal growth  like giving birth to your new self designed by you the results pay off big time the secret here is to fall in love with the process of growth with the feeling of freeing oneself from old shackles enjoying the virtues we are developing action step create some space in your life for selfawareness and personal development nothing will make a bigger impact than this investment in yourself think what could be your first step in this journey conclusion wow you

lactose intolerant and dont know it num dairy weakens bones can lead to osteoporosis and is linked to cancer num dairy products are particularly susceptible to radiation contamination naturalnews dairy foods make a delicious and satisfying complement to many peoples diets however there is a large body of evidence that suggests that most peoples bodies are just not well equipped to digest and process dairybased foods and beverages unless you happen to be a sherpa from the tibetan highlands and as our environment gets more polluted reasons to reduce dairy consumption increase rather than stay the same here are some convincing reasons to reduce or even eliminate dairy from your dietconsumption of dairy has varying effects on different people some people are so sensitive to dairy that ingesting even a small amount can be fatal if they have anaphylaxis a severe potentially fatal allergic reaction that can result in rashes swelling hives itching trouble breathing wheezing or even loss of consciousness in a separate category from allergenics are people who are lactose intolerant lactose intolerance happens when a person is lacking lactase an enzyme which breaks down the lactose sugars in dairy without lactase a person cannot break down and digest dairy foods and may experience bloating cramps gas and diarrheamost people in the world are actually lactose intolerant but are unaware of it it is estimated that num of the worlds citizens generally lack the lactase enzyme needed to break down lactose into the simpler sugar forms glucose and galactose which the body can process effectively for most of the 20th century it has been generally accepted that almost all humans could break down lactose but this was proven incorrect by research conducted during dates which found that most people lose the lactase enzyme after being weaned as children usually between the ages of two and five a small percentage of humans such as tibetan sherpas and their relatives do retain the lactase enzyme throughout adulthood due to evolutionary adaptivitymost of us have been deceived by the usdas nutritional guidelines into believing that dairy is a healthy part of a balanced diet and that \"diets rich in milk and dairy products help build and maintain bone mass throughout the lifecycle and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis \" these statements unfortunately are misleading and even dangerous studies have found that the highest rates of osteoporosis occur in countries with high consumption of animal products this research suggests that rather than building strong bones and teeth dairy products prevent calcium from being absorbed in the bodyhigh quality plantbased foods such as broccoli kale and collard greens provide much more easily absorbable calcium than dairy these should be used in place of dairy as healthy sources of calciumthere are many other convincing reasons to avoid dairy besides the risk of osteoporosis research has shown that dairy consumption is linked to cancer heart disease and diabetesever since the fukushima disaster in num researchers have been testing foods and vegetables for radioactivity the department of nuclear engineering at uc berkeley has been taking radiation samples since the fukushima meltdown they have tested both raw milk and storebought and have detected radioactive isotopes cesiumnum and num csnum

life after death be proven by bob daulby in a confused world of science religion and society at large whereby no two people or group seem to agree or reach some kind of common ground that we could all cling to with some hope the existence of a life existing after death is an ever deepening problem to solve perhaps then it can never be solved through a generic means but by and through a personal one instead perhaps proof of life after death was never meant for the public at large but only for those willinmg to tread the path that angels fear to tread what is the problem if there is a problem at all when trying to establish the existence of a life after our passing here it is proof in having read many articles concerning this topic it can be easily seen that so many of us have ideas  and often very different ideas at that  but that i have yet to come across just one that will bring each of us this much needed proof what about death anyway although most of us will go through life not giving another thought to our sure passing yet there comes a time in all our lives when we are suddenly confronted with death in such a way that we cannot ignore it any longer and so we will ask ourselves then will i live on after this life as far as i am concerned death is not something that we should push aside out of dread or ignorance but is something that we should study as soon as we are able to this is so that when  not ‘if’  we are confronted with death it will not come as a shock and more importantly it will also not be a source of grief either but rather one of joy existence num photo credit vincepal through instilled religion society has taught us to be afraid of death to compound this fear we are also taught to ‘poohpooh’ or deride the possibility of life existing after death  whereby we continue forever onwards anyway  as a topic for the ‘illadvised’ or the ‘ignorant’ to make matters even more fearful and confusing for us experts psychics shamans priests ministers or whoever can not only not bring us this much needed proof but that should proof ever arise at all then no one agrees that it is it is because of this lack of agreement  the need to reach common ground  that we the public at large lose out in short if there weren’t quite so many egos and wannabes out there believing that they are the only ones who hold ‘the truth’ then we would not suffer as we do as far as death and a life after death is concerned and so in bearing these in mind it becomes all the more necessary to not only find the existence of life after death but also to be able to prove it leaving us in no doubt that we too  shall live on so what about proof in having now been in actual contact with our worlds beyond for a very long time now from my own experiences i can now reveal that an allround generic proof of a life existing after our deaths is a long way off if not nigh impossible until science itself can reach a general consensus  which is highly unlikely and this because ‘they’ can’t agree either  then the very idea of finding this irrefutable proof that will cross all boundaries regardless of their origins  is but a distant dream and so when skeptics use this angle  the need for the irrefutable  is already a lost argument and so as they gain believers lose most of all we all lose so what is to be done about this generic vs personal proof during my many years of experience with our socalled ‘unknown’ along the way i have brought even total strangers to my sessions to note not only their reaction but also as to what they say is ‘proof’ it was during this period of my research that i have discovered that although generic proof is not yet available yet ‘personal’ proof is not only is personal proof available but it has been available since man first walked upon this planet let me give you an example of personal proof existence photo credit photosynthetica when i first made friends with computers got myself on the internet etc to be in actual contact with someone from peru to me was an out and out miracle but what compounded that miracle was that after only a month i recieved a letter from him which proved to me that he existed and that he did indeed come from peru to me this was personal proof of someone i met through this new fangled means of communication at the time the above is personal proof  for me and only me and yet to you this is all a fairy tale why because you were not there you didn’t speak to him you did not experience any of this and you did not recieve a letter from peru thus why should you ‘believe’ me had you not been taught geography at school then to you even peru would not exist would it ignorance is also taught unlike me you have not been taught about the true existence of life after death and so to you until you are taught then you will always doubt and you will always require proof until you are taught until you receive your own personal proof this proof will always elude you it’s time to learn isn’t it and so in having learned and shown that peru really does exist after all what would the future hold for someone who has given up fickle ‘belief‘ altogether and now knows at last in conclusion if you are curious as to how you too can remove doubt and fear from your psychi so that you too can venture out into lands previously unknown to you to also know exactly what to expect upon your own passing and of how joyful it truly is and why in a very real way leaving behind you the insecurity of tepid beliefs then by all means visit my website where you too will find that the door to

blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next something that modern civilization has counted upon during times of crisis is outside help from those in a better situation news of disaster travels around the region sometimes whole areas of the world and people donate time and money to assist those who are in a bad way the process of decline is hastened by climate change because of the limits that are reached as resources are strained to the breaking as disasters pile up here is an npr article about this very process unfolding this very year url listing donations during every subsequent disaster this year showing a marked decline the article goes on to say all this has happened as the world was already grappling with some of the largest humanitarian crises since world war ii num million people at risk of dying from starvation and disease due to conflicts and drought in nigeria somalia south sudan and yemen so within the us government it’s not just exclusively domestic agencies like fema that are in allhandsondeck mode right now at the cdc where talley works for a branch that focuses on overseas emergencies we have staff around the world responding similarly usaid the agency that delivers us assistance to poor countries has deployed six separate disaster response teams — which can consist of as many as several dozen staffers — including teams to help displaced people from syria and iraq this is only the second time that we’ve had six teams mobilized at once notes alex mahoney a top official with the agency’s office of us foreign disaster assistance or ofda the last time was during the ebola outbreak in west africa so yes it’s unusual he says it’s well worth reading and explains that agencies all over the world that rely on us support including the us are stretched to their limits and beyond donations are dropping in a process that is called donation fatigue due to both private parties and governmental organizations using their volunteers and resources until no more of either is left and replacements are slow to arrive it appears that any more disasters after this pile up may well face the unthinkable little to no help at all the timing appears to be part of the problem with the lack of help for puerto rico for instance or the devastating fires in california… we are at the point where both funds and active participants are just about out of commission i believe that climate change means more years will be like this last one and that soon maybe within a decade it may well be that local disasters will be met with local help and not much more than that and many devastating disaster survivors will find they are on their own this would mean that the collapse of modern civilization may take far less time than typical declines of previous eras the mentality of generosity to strangers could shift to that of battening down the hatches for your own area and people we all should hope not the longer we can maintain infrastructures

excerpt from num searching for meaning continued ‘the religion of feelings’ ‘the religion of trueself’ the ‘religion’ no one wants to know about yet the one we all need to live if we want to feel truly happy and loved mary i want you also to understand james what you said about marion coming to it all herself  all through her own feelings is very important because it’s because of her doing that that i’ve been able to come to you both and even though i don’t have anything personally to do with marion as in we don’t speak to each other like i do with you still i have been with her through her whole life as she’s suffered all her feeling abuse and by her choosing to live true to herself which means true to her feelings so i’ve been able to come to you and shed more of the conceptual light on it all for you both and so has then jesus been able to come to you as well joining me in our revelation to you about all of this  your feelingdenial state your evilness your rebellion sorry mary but i’m still coming to terms with what you said earlier in the previous post that really we don’t need any formal religions at all like no churches no priests no religious men or women no holy places no nothing like any of that that’s right james you don’t you can still of course have holy places and places of worship prayer and meditation but these would be places you would go to be with others or quiet places to long to your mother and father for their divine love and as well such places could simply be places you go to sharing your experiences and expressing your feelings as you seek the truth of them however really your whole life is your spiritual experience you long for the divine love of god when you feel you want to long for it and you long for the truth of your feelings when you feel you want to long for the truth of them and you keep striving to express all your feelings to your partner and ideally out in the world if other people are also open to it  if they are understanding and sharing the same intention in life to imagine that one day humanity will not have such religions… that’s hard to imagine one day it will happen but not for a long time however in the mean time as more people come to understand about the significance of their feelings and their relationship with the truth and as they venture into doing their feelinghealing or soulhealing which is inclusive of their feelinghealing together with longing to become atone with god through longing to the mother and father for their divine love then less power and control will such institutions have

the full spectrum of conscious living click here to see all we share regaining your confidence by carl greer phd psyd do you lose confidence after a loss or failure if it’s a particularly big loss or failure or part of a series of failures it may be difficult to have faith in yourself afterward lost confidence can affect you for years and become embedded in your story as a recurring theme that seems to have a life of its own even if you try to hide your insecurity others may pick up on it because you telegraph it though your words actions attitudes and body language then no matter how much you try you seem to have bad luck you sabotage your successes and don’t know why failure becomes a selffulfilling prophecy we’ve all known someone who seems to have an air of desperation and fear about achieving a goal—and that person may be us most have experienced a loss of confidence and a resulting fear that we’ll never get it back it can be helpful to think of lost confidence as a lost soul part that separated from you and can be reclaimed and reabsorbed and reintegrated into who you are through discovering the part of yourself that has confidence in some arena you can reclaim the energy of confidence and let it propel you forward if you have failed at business after business or job after job you might spend some time pursuing an interest that you have achieved success in you might even discover the seed for a new business many entrepreneurs have built successful businesses around a talent or skill they had previously undervalued then too the energetic imprint of being a failure is simply an aspect of being vulnerable when we feel insecure we’re recognizing that we don’t have expertise that our control is limited and that we have much to learn vulnerability and what the buddhists call ‘beginner’s mind’ can be an asset if you need to learn something new confidence may build as you achieve mastery recognizing that you are not a master is the first step in becoming one you may need to learn more about developing a healthy relationship or business partnership you may need to learn the art of tolerating your discomfort in discovering your weaknesses and holes in

disabled boy who had been badly beaten by young thugs shouting antitrump epithets in a video that had been posted on facebook trump loved that answer and started venting about his media coverage hicks retreated to a nearby desk where she spoke to times reporter patrick healy he had called trump’s cellphone during the globes and then quoted the presidentelect as saying he wasn’t surprised by

the internet to hopefully spread word to the public and those in the scientific community about a pressing matter he claims the high costs of ‘flagship’ missions are keeping other important and crucial missions stuck on the ‘drawing board’ he says he is worried because the golden age we have been in seems to be coming to an end sure no golden age lasts forever but we are putting an end to this one far too soon there seems to be good reason behind what he is saying elvis wrote in scientific american as follows our early successes came from looking through new windows across a vast range of wavelengths invisible to the naked eye the first radio xray ultraviolet and infrared telescopes were small but everything we saw through them was new and mysterious the next generation of telescopes leaped forward in capabilities leading to the discoveries of neutron stars black holes radiation left over from the big bang dark matter dark energy dark energy exoplanets … the list goes on but this greater power came at a cost—literally since each new generation of telescopes carried a price tag several times higher than that of the one before today a single telescope can now take almost a full decade’s worth of nasa’s budget for big astronomy the james webb space telescope jwst now scheduled for launch next year takes the prize at about num billion the glory of our golden age has been that we can access the whole electromagnetic spectrum at the same time the discovery of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars is a perfect example groundbased detectors spotted these ripples in spacetime but followup observations with gammaray xray and visiblelight telescopes gave us a far more complete understanding of how the event unfolded ideally we need several comparably sensitive flagship telescopes on a par with jwst and they need to be flying at the same time yet such flagships are only designed to last about five years although that can often be stretched to num when the infraredsensitive jwst flies it will be num to num times more powerful than its predecessors the hubble and spitzer space telescopes but if new flagships cost as much as jwst it will be a decade before even one can be launched by that time jwst itself will likely be on its last legs so every discovery made by the webb telescope will take over a decade to follow up by then we’ll have forgotten what it was that we wanted to know in the first place advances in astronomy will slow to a snail’s pace elvis says that the way we respond to crises like this make a huge difference in how things go down he noted that we do not have to simply accept this we can respond in a different manner and change the outcome he believes a new program needs to be put in place and it should be one requiring multiple new missions you can read his full article by clicking here or in the video below what do you think about all of this', 'the new year is a new beginning full of

element nickel at the time of the extinction using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer which measures the abundance of rare elements at their atomic level the scientists documented anomalous peaks of nickel in regions ranging from the arctic to india at the time of the great permian extinction they say this is most likely to have come from huge volcanic eruptions as rocks formed from cooling lava contain some of the biggest nickel deposits on the planet nyu geologist michael rampino explained that exploding volcanoes in siberia likely caused intense global warming which was

explosive interview with two rockefeller trilateral commission members highlighting how much political power can be controlled in a few hands people often misunderstand how the game works in the area of us foreign policy for example they focus on the longstanding rats’ nest called the state department well they should but that bureaucracy implements policy it doesn’t really formulate the basics the basics come from higher on the food chain the globalist movement—within which the trilateral commission is a leading force—dictates a oneworld theme separate nations and their power should be melted down and folded into one planetwide management system this system would ultimately determine worldwide production quotas for goods and services and their distribution energy in particular is a prime target how much will be created who will benefit who will suffer the us federal government and other governments around the world are currently trying to bring us closer to that utopian day who sits in the shadows pulling their strings here is another question that has the same answer who is in charge of undermining free markets and thus taking down economies one group has been virtually forgotten its influence is enormous it has existed sdate it’s called the trilateral commission tc keep in mind that the original stated goal of the tc was to create a new international economic order in num four years before birthing the tc with david rockefeller zbigniew brzezinski wrote the nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force international banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state goodbye separate nations any doubt on the question of tc goals is answered by david rockefeller himself the founder of the tc in his memoirs num some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united

trilateral commission and elite planning for world management ed by holly skdate south end press pages numnum the conversation was public knowledge at the time anyone who was anyone in washington politics in media in thinktanks had access to it understood its meaning but no one shouted from the rooftops no one used the conversation to force a scandal no one protested loudly the conversation revealed that the entire basis of the us constitution had been torpedoed that the people who were running us national policy which includes trade treaties were agents of an elite shadow group no question about it and yet official silence media silence the dept of justice made no moves congress undertook no serious inquiries and the president jimmy carter issued no statements carter was himself an agent of the trilateral commission in the white house he had been plucked from obscurity by david rockefeller and through elite tc press connections vaulted into the spotlight as a preeminent choice for the presidency date conversation featured reporter jeremiah novak and two trilateral commission members karl kaiser and richard cooper the interview took up the issue of who exactly during president carter’s administration was formulating us economic and political policy the careless and offhand attitude of trilateralists kaiser and cooper is astonishing it’s as if they’re saying what we’re revealing is already out in the open it’s too late to do anything about it why are you so worked up we’ve already won… novak the reporter is it true that a private trilateral committee led by henry owen of the us and made up of trilateral representatives of the us uk west germany japan france and the eec is coordinating the economic and political policies of the trilateral countries which would include the us cooper yes they have met three times novak yet in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize ‘this function might well prove offensive to some of the trilateral and other countries which do not take part’ who are you afraid of kaiser many countries in europe would resent the dominant role that west germany plays at these trilateral meetings cooper many people still live in a world of separate nations and they would resent such coordination of policy novak but this trilateral committee is essential to your whole policy how can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support for its decisions on how trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies cooper well i guess it’s the press’ job to publicize it novak yes but why doesn’t president carter come out with it and tell the american people that us economic and political power is being coordinated by a trilateral committee made up of henry owen and six others after all if us policy is being made on a multinational level the people should know cooper president carter and secretary of state vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches a lie kaiser it just hasn’t become an issue this interview slipped under the mainstream media radar which is to say it was buried us economic and political policy—run by a committee of the trilateral commission when jimmy carter won the presidential election in num his aide hamilton jordan said that if after the inauguration cy vance and brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser we’ve lost and i’ll quit lost—because both men were powerful members of the trilateral commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of white house control to the commission vance and brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser as jordan feared but he didn’t quit he became carter’s chief of staff now consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past num years on so many levels to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the world are a single collective from a very high level of political and economic power this propaganda op has had the objective of grooming the population for a planet that is one coagulated mass run and managed by one force a central

the then chief of police in los angeles called a press conference wherein he refuted the findings of the superior court judge who granted our exoneration and release the los angeles city council called for his immediate resignation or face being fired for his statements to the public through the press i want to reveal to the public the years of persecution and false imprisonment i have been

blockchain stocks are next the woman made infamous for flipping off president donald trump’s motorcade says she was fired from her job for her childish behavior juli briskman said the marketing company bosses called her in and gave her the boot but nonetheless the numyearold says she has no regrets about flipping off the president’s motorcade briskman was cycling in virginia last month when she offered the gesture in what she described as a gut reaction to donald trump’s policies he was passing by and my blood just started to boil she told the huffington post i’m thinking daca aka dreamers children of illegal immigrants who were allowed to stay in the united states recipients are getting kicked out he pulled ads for open enrollment in obamacare only onethird of puerto rico has power i’m thinking he’s at the damn golf course again a photographer traveling with the presidential motorcade snapped briskman’s picture and the image quickly spread across news outlets and social media many hailed briskman as a hero with some saying she should run in date election while others called her disrespectful emotionally driven and childish i flipped off the motorcade a number of times briskman added but her bosses didn’t find her little stunt all that entertaining or in accordance with how the company perceives the manner in which an employee should conduct themselves in or out of the workplace briskman had been working as a marketing and communications specialist for a virginiabased federal contractor akima for six months she thought it best detail to the human resources department that she was now infamous for being emotionally unstable and flipping off the president with all of the online fuss around her actions the company would have likely found out about her antics anyway bosses called her into a meeting after she ratted herself out she said they said ‘we’re separating from you’ briskman told the huffington post ‘basically you cannot have lewd or obscene things in your social media’ so they were calling flipping him off obscene unfortunately for briskman that’s fairly common among companies most want their employees to behave in a manner befitting the company including on social media and flipping off the president probably didn’t make akima look all that great one would expect the exact same reaction from a boss should a person have been fired for flipping off president obama’s motorcade she said the company was displeased she had used the image as her profile picture on twitter and facebook and the bosses told her that using the image violated social media policy and could hurt the company’s reputation as a government contractor briskman said she pointed out that her social media pages do not mention her employer she also tried to shift blame when she said another employee had written a profane insult about someone on facebook but had been allowed to keep his job after deleting the post and being reprimanded unfortunately briskman cannot simply delete what she did considering the photo went viral but it’s oddly amusing she tried to throw a fellow employee under the bus for her misdeeds virginia however has at will employment laws meaning privatesector employers can fire anyone for any reason suddenly the emotionally unstable numyearold mother of two found herself looking for a new job briskman who votes democratic big surprise said she planned to look for a new job with an advocacy group she believes in such as planned parenthood or people for the ethical treatment of animals peta that seems

not medical cannabismarijuana which continues to prove its merits and gain acceptance industrial hemp’s use should be a nobrainer but it’s a complex boondoggle of legal and bureaucratic nonsense even without thc the molecule that leads to reefer madness industrial hemp commercial cultivation is legal in canada but the usa hemp industry was pushed to the side by government connected industry insiders whose monopolies were threatened when it appeared hemp may boom and compete for the very products of their monopolist concerns cdate the hemp industry had been given a mechanical invention gift known as the decoricator machine was invented it was a machine that was to hemp what the 19th century cotton gin was it replaced hand shredding of hemp to glean its fibers fibers that could be used for textiles clothing paper and plastic with the advent of the decoricator hemp would have been able to take over competing industries in paper textiles for clothing and other applications fuel and plastics growing hemp in abundance was easy and it’s plant to harvest time was no more than six months according to popular mechanics during that time num acres devoted to hemp will produce as much paper as num acres of average forest pulp land then a small number of large businesses with competition concerns used high level government connections to push through the marijuana tax act of num the ensuing marijuana scares hyped by movies such as reefer madness brought about more legislation that would prohibit all hemp cultivation even hemp without thc prior to this even without the high speed decoricator hemp was an easy cash crop for small farmers some of whom were recruited to continue cultivating hemp during ww ii to provide hemp fibers for us naval ships’ ropes as well as other military applications and prior to that hemp was so important during colonial and early american times that farmers were virtually required to cultivate it along with their other crops george

seeds their powders and cold pressed oils provide all the essential amino acids for easily digested high protein hemp is not only very high in omeganum but it provides an almost perfect ratio of omeganum to omeganum it is truly a super food that you can buy in health food stores or online the seeds come from canada where industrial hemp is legal hemp is so nutritionally dense that one could survive on hemp seeds alone during extreme food shortages if hemp were legal you could easily grow your own hemp improves farming aquaponics hemp plants don’t need pesticides or synthetic fertilizers which rely mostly on the phosphate industry a phosphate industry byproduct is the sodium fluoride that is sold to municipality water works for our poisoned tap water the runoff from fields of phosphate fertilizers into waterways that merge with seawater is causing all sorts of nitrogen and phosphorous excesses and imbalances leading to algae that stifles the water’s ecological support systems hemp’s thick roots ward off weeds and growing hemp improves the soil’s nitrogen making that soil better for other crops they would be useful and lucrative rotation crops for organic farmers

plastics are durable and heat resistant and they are biodegradable recently the french auto industry use hemp to manufacture some of its automobile parts henry ford pioneered this in num when he built his vegetable car with hemp and flax it was stronger and lighter than steel cars ford’s hempmobile also used hemp biodiesel fuel which creates very little pollution the petroleum industry didn’t want to see or hear that hemp seeds were even used to make paints and lacquers in the mid1930s petrochemical plastics for all purposes could be replaced with hemp plastics that are nontoxic and

completely reverses depression breakthrough study  of readers think this story is fact add your two cents headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next magnesium is already known by many as a tremendous booster of health it contributes to sound sleep helps with digestion and constipation relieves muscle aches and even improves heart health and migraine headaches  but here’s a shocker magnesium in small doses leads to an astonishing reversal of depression what is magnesium and why do we need it magnesium is one of the most important elements in the human body it is a micronutrient and mineral that is involved in thousands of biochemical processes crucial for the proper functioning of the cardiovascular alimentary endocrine and osteoarticular systems but oddly it seems absolutely vital to regulating our mood and levels of happiness in a breakthrough study conducted by researchers at the larner college of medicine at the university of vermont and published in plos one has found that just 248mg of magnesium per day leads to an aboutface of depression symptoms in study subjects new clinical research results show magnesium is effective at addressing symptoms and is safer and easier on the wallet than prescription therapies reports science daily mounds of research proving we need magnesium to combat depression research of this kind regarding magnesium isn’t new but it stands to reinforce what nutritionists health coaches and even some psychologists have been stating for decades another study states this about magnesium and depression anxiety related conditions are the most common affective disorders present in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of over num magnesium mg status is associated with subjective anxiety leading to the proposition that mg supplementation may attenuate anxiety symptoms and this study explains that after adjusting for all potential confounders the strength of the association of very low magnesium intake with depression was statistically significant rr  num num ci numnum or how about this study which states that the daily consumption of num mg magnesium    tablets for ≥num wk by depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency leads to improvements in depression status and magnesium levels so while not all the studies agree on the exact amount of magnesium that we need each day to combat depression they repeat over and over in hundreds of additional studies that depleted magnesium levels contribute to depression why we’re all magnesium deficient depleted soil why are so many of us magnesium deficient aside from the fact that many vital micronutrients and minerals we need have been raped from the soil via industrial farming practices and by adding nonorganic toxic chemical fertilizers and herbicides to the very soil which must grow our food too much sugar we also eat too much sugar is this a coincidence the sugar industry has been hiding the effects of sugar on us for decades  and one of those effects is that sugar eats up our magnesium stores refined sugar causes you to waste most vitamin and minerals in the body mainly bvitamins potassium magnesium zinc and manganese sugar raises co2 levels in the blood which causes you to go to bicarbonate stores which buffer it causing a depletion of minerals like magnesium stress another culprit is stress  both mental and physical stress with its related continuous flow of adrenaline uses up our magnesium stores rapidly adrenaline affects heart rate blood pressure vascular constriction and muscle contraction— actions that all demand steady supplies of magnesium for smooth function and without it you can guess what happens we also require magnesium to create serotonin one of the happy hormones which prevents depression stress causes less serotonin to be created and replaces it with cortisol and other stress hormones stress and depression are inextricably linked without enough magnesium we haven’t got a chance at fighting depression naturally detoxification magnesium is a powerful detoxifier it removes everything from heavy metals to glyphosate and other herbicides from our bodies as well as thousands of environmental toxins and metabolic toxins if we become overly toxic due to a lack of magnesium we are more likely be depressed as the brain suffers from inflammation it cannot overcome is it any wonder we suffer from the following additional diseases aside from depression all of which are linked to magnesium deficiency gastrointestinal disorders prolonged diarrhea crohn’s disease malabsorption syndromes celiac disease surgical removal of a portion of the intestine and intestinal inflammation due to radiation may all lead to magnesium depletion renal disorders magnesium wasting diabetes mellitus and longterm use of certain diuretics see drug interactions may result in increased urinary loss of magnesium multiple other medications can also result in renal magnesium wasting chronic alcoholism poor dietary intake gastrointestinal problems and increased urinary loss of magnesium may all contribute to magnesium depletion which is frequently encountered in alcoholics age several studies have found that elderly people have relatively low dietary intakes of magnesium intestinal magnesium absorption tends to decrease with age and urinary magnesium excretion tends to increase with age thus suboptimal dietary magnesium intake may increase the risk of magnesium depletion in the elderly how much magnesium do i need and where can i get it so how much magnesium should you take general dosage recommendations range from about num to num milligrams per pound of body weight experiment with a supplement and you’ll know exactly how much you need you can also consume natural sources of magnesium which can be found in foods like spinach chard almonds greek yogurt black beans avocado coriander salmon pumpkin seeds yogurt or kefir

received by beijing nguyen phu trong general secretary of the communist party of vietnam cpv was treated much in the same manner during his official trip to china last week yet while mr trong’s visit was aimed at developing stronger ties with china it does not mean that the communist leadership in hanoi is pursuing a dutertelike pivot to beijing closer ties with beijing trong’s fourday trip which started on january num was his first to china since being reelected as the cpv’s leader at its 12th national congress in jandate and his first foreign tour in num he went to beijing with a highranking delegation that included four politburo members in charge of four important departments in vietnam’s oneparty regime  namely central propaganda foreign affairs national defense and public security during the visit hanoi and beijing reached a wide range of agreements aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two ruling parties and the two communist neighbors in various fields and at many levels trong’s outing was followed by recent notable trips to the asian juggernaut by other vietnamese top officials  including prime minister nguyen xuan phuc and dinh the huynh the cpv’s permanent secretary in september and octdate respectively mr huynh an influential politburo member is tipped to succeed trong if the numyear old leader chooses to step down in the near future all these journeys suggest hanoi is attaching a greater importance to its cooperation with beijing and adopting a more friendly posture toward the latter than about six or seven months ago a combination of factor may contribute to this change one of these is the fact that china is vietnam’s closest neighbor sharing not only land and sea borders but also many political and economic similarities with the former the world’s most populous country is also vietnam’s biggest trading partner given all of these coupled with vietnam’s power asymmetry visàvis its giant neighbor for the country’s stability  and perhaps for the cpv’s survival  steadying its ties with beijing is always a priority for hanoi chinese leaders’ current charm diplomacy is also influencing hanoi’s posture mr trong was the first foreign leader china received in num he was given a redcarpet welcome upon his arrival at the beijing international airport and an official welcoming ceremony with full honors at the great hall of the people in beijing on january num five of the seven members of the allpowerful standing committee of the politburo of the communist party of china cpc including president xi jinping and premier li keqiang held talks with him mr phuc was given a similar treatment when he toured china last september the warm reception chinese leaders extended to their vietnamese comrades and brothers indicates that beijing is also highly valuing hanoi and its relations with the latter this in return is increasing vietnam’s trust  or at least decreasing its mistrust  in beijing and encouraging it to develop tighter ties with china it seems tensions and suspicion caused by china’s actions in recent years notably its placement of its huge oil rig hsnum in vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in num have now eased overt overtures made toward beijing by several regional countries particularly malaysia and the philippines are another defining factor last november malaysian prime minster najib razak made a sixday trip to china during that visit which was intended to elevate their relationship to greater heights kuala lumpur and beijing signed many new agreements including malaysia’s first major defense deal with china two weeks before that president rodrigo duterte also made a landmark trip to beijing where he eventually and solemnly announced his separation from the us and his dependence on china after months of publicly denouncing washington and praising beijing malaysia’s turn toward beijing and especially the philippines’ dramatic tilt away from its longstanding and most important ally to china’s orbit somehow influenced a rethink in hanoi like vietnam malaysia and the philippines have outstanding territorial disputes with china in the south china sea for years they were among the region’s most vocal critics of their northern neighbor’s expansive claims and aggressive actions in this resourcerich and strategically vital water they all favored multilateral approaches to the maritime disputes hanoi supported the philippines’s south china sea arbitration and welcomed its landmark legal victory against china last july duterte’s wholehearted embrace of china which resulted in his sidelining of the july ruling and agreeing to enter bilateral talks with beijing prompted vietnam to soften its posture and improve relations with china last but not least donald trump’s shock rise to the american presidency is also a key reason behind hanoi’s current accommodating posture toward beijing under the obama administration vietnam and america edged remarkably closer to each other their stronger ties were strengthened by  and manifested in  many key developments and agreements prominent among these are mr trong’s unprecedented trip to washington in num president obama’s milestone visit to vietnam in num during which he officially ended america’s decadesold arms embargo on its former war foe and vietnam’s enthusiastic response to america’s asia pivot and the usled tpp vietnam’s strong economic and strategic ties with the us have been in jeopardy following trump’s election victory faced with the imminent collapse of the tpp and other uncertainties about america’s relations with asia and vietnam under trump hanoi is relatively readjusting its foreign policy and improving its ties with beijing can be seen as part of such recalibration but not a dutertelike shift yet while becoming more receptive to beijing hanoi is not bandwagoning with the latter and this is because of many reasons one of these concerns vietnam’s economic imbalance with china though it has dropped recently vietnam’s trade deficit with the world’s second biggest economy remains enormous according to its general statistics office gso in num vietnam exported usnum billion in goods to the world’s largest trading country and imported num billion from it this means it had a trade deficit of num billion with china last year for years hanoi has asked beijing to help balance the bilateral trade by creating better conditions for vietnamese goods to enter the chinese market it is reported that in his talk with nguyen phu trong xi jinping promised that china will work harder to make the two countries’ trade relations grow faster and become more balanced whether vietnam’s companies and their goods are provided with a greater access to china following trong’s visit remains to be seen yet in any case it will take years or decades if ever for vietnam to balance its trade with china for this reason  and in order to avoid economic overdependence on its giant neighbor and to sustain its economic development  vietnam needs good relations with its other major trading partners notably the european union and the us with which it has enjoyed a huge trade surplus in recent years in num vietnam exported usnum billion in goods to the eu its third largest trading partner and usnum billion to the us as america is vietnam’s biggest export market and second largest trader while it is unclear how donald trump will view and approach his country’s relations with vietnam it is certain that hanoi will try its best to sustain and improve its ties with washington another reason why vietnam is seeking better relations with the us and other powers including japan and india is its unresolved maritime disputes with china during trong’s china visit both sides pledged to manage maritime differences and avoid any acts that may complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the south china sea nevertheless after candidly exchanging their views on issue they could not yet accept each other’s main position according to a report by the vov vietnam’s national radio broadcaster in his talk with his chinese counterpart trong asserted vietnam’s consistent stance of persistently dealing with the dispute in the east sea vietnam’s name for the south china sea by peaceful measures in compliance with international law including date united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos and with respect to diplomatic and legal processes in contrast as manifested by its vehement objection to the philippines’ arbitration case beijing has stringently opposed any legal approach to resolve the disputes instead it has forcibly insisted on bilateral negotiations their joint communique mentioned neither of these two positions given china’s expansive claims and its past and recent actions in the south china sea vietnam does not expect  though it strongly hopes  that beijing will willingly accept a peaceful solution to the dispute based on the principles of international law including unclos that is why it has hedged  and continues to hedge  against any aggressive move by china by forging strong ties with global and regional powers notably those that are also concerned about beijing’s hegemonic ambitions this is supported by the fact that whilst trong was holding talks with chinese leaders in beijing in hanoi nguyen xuan phuc received john kerry the latter’s visit might not have a major impact on future usvietnam cooperation yet in his talk with the outgoing us secretary of state the vietnamese premier expressed his delight at achievements in usvietnam relations and vietnam’s desire to reinforce bilateral ties this shows the vietnamese leadership really values its relationship with washington just a day after trong returned from china hanoi received shinzo abe in their separate meetings with the japanese prime minister the southeast asian country’s top four leaders  party chief state president prime minister and parliament chairwoman  all affirmed hanoi’s desire to deepen economic and strategic ties with japan for his part during this twoday visit mr abe pledged to provide vietnam with six new coastguard patrols the patrol vessels worth num million were part of the numbillion loan tokyo offered hanoi vietnamjapan relations have significantly advanced in recent years and this is mainly due to their shared concerns over china’s maritime ambitions and actions such apprehensions have also brought vietnam closer to india china’s other key regional rival six months ago before phuc’s china trip hanoi hosted prime minister narendra modi during that landmark visit the first official trip to vietnam by an indian prime minister sdate the two countries elevated their strategic partnership to comprehensive strategic partnership and new delhi agreed to provide vietnam with a num million defense loan all of these demonstrate that while it may prioritize relations with beijing hanoi is also seeking stronger ties with other powers notably the us japan and india to counterbalance china both economically and strategically it is also evident that the vietnamese leadership is not overtly leaning toward beijing and submitting to the latter’s maritime position as president duterte has done following duterte’s china visit last october during which he publicly promised to shift his country’s allegiance from washington to beijing some international relations experts notably those from china predicted that america’s other asian partners such as vietnam may follow suit ahead of trong’s visit last week an article in the global times a spinoff of the people’s daily the cpc’s mouthpiece also suggested that the shift in diplomacy by the philippine leader sets a good example for the other southeast asian countries including vietnam judging by mr trong’s assertion of vietnam’s maritime position in his talk with the chinese leader and other diplomatic and strategic moves recently taken by hanoi it is apparent that vietnamese leaders are not following mr duterte’s steps or example instead they remain firmly committed to their longheld foreign policy of independence diversification and multilateralization that has enabled vietnam to develop good  and generally fruitful  relations with many countries including all the world’s major powers and the region’s countries atimescom', 'potentially explosive details revealed in fusion gps cofounder’s testimony transcript  of readers think this story is fact add your two cents headline bitcoin  blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next this week the house intelligence committee agreed to release the transcripts from the date testimony of glenn simpson cofounder of fusion gps fusion gps as we all know is the research firm employed to gather research on donald trump during date election cycle  first by conservative news site the washington free beacon and then picked up by the clinton campaign there’s been a lot of controversy surrounding the dossier produced through those efforts some details have been proven some disproved and others remain unsubstantiated whatever the case republican lawmakers insist an unsubstantiated dossier was the sole impetus for the ongoing probe into russian interference in date election as well as possible collusion by trump’s team and they want the investigation shut down democrats predictably want to push further desperate to prove that they didn’t make a bad decision by installing hillary clinton as their handpicked candidate for the presidency then there are those who are standing in between with suspicions and maybe some doubts but who ultimately want to hear everything and get to the truth that would be where i’m at actually and speaking of everything what do the released transcripts of simpson’s testimony reveal keeping in mind that this was simpson speaking about what his firm suspected the transcripts show that there was suspicions of something beyond just an election those transcripts reveal serious allegations that the trump organization may have engaged in money laundering with russian nationals representative adam schiff said may have and honestly the rumors of trump and his organization being neckdeep in dealings with the russian mob have been around for years these aren’t campaigngenerated accusations talk to longtime residents of new york and new jersey and you get the impression that it’s a badly kept secret so what brought simpson and his company to suspect such nefarious activities in his testimony simpson said that his firm closely examined sales of condominiums in trump properties in new york miami panama city and toronto there were a lot of real estate deals where you couldn’t really tell who was buying the property simpson said and sometimes properties would be bought and sold and they would be bought for one price and sold for a loss shortly thereafter and it really didn’t make sense to us we saw patterns of buying and selling that we thought were suggestive of moneylaundering he continued the trump organization’s chief counsel alan garten claims that the properties referenced by simpson were simply properties trump had licensed his name to rather than having any substantial interest in these accusations are completely reckless and unsubstantiated for a multitude of reasons garten said these issues have nothing to do with the scope of the investigation by the house intelligence committee garten said in a phone interview but it’s not surprising the minority democrats would focus on this given they’ve found absolutely no evidence of collusion he’s not wrong i don’t think the ongoing russia probe was meant to target potential criminal activity such as money laundering i do believe however that if money laundering or any other criminal activity is swept up in the ongoing investigation it could certainly go to motive simpson’s testimony also revealed suspicions that russia sought to infiltrate us politics through powerful lobbies such as the national rifle association i mentioned that situation earlier this week they also attempted to influence groups that promote independence for texas and california they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the nra simpson said according to the transcript so where do we go from here given this information we keep digging this shouldn’t be considered a partisan issue it should raise enough concerns that responsible american citizens want to know everything before making a decision the post potentially explosive

intergovernmental communiqués all in an effort to unearth factpatterns of selfdealing and cronyism malfeasance and graft my work is zoomed in specific granular the conservative movement needs its sleuths but what i love about levin’s plunder and deceit is its philosophical breadth and panoramic sweep powered by intellectual titans like edmund burke alexis de tocqueville and james madison levin urges young people to embark upon the creation of a new civil rights movement one that snaps the manacles of statist power and embraces an intellectual and economic freedom that excites and animates the moral imagination best of all levin respects young readers enough to shoot straight with them the road to serfdom is breezy the march to liberty painstaking yet as he reminds us the fruits of the latter far eclipse the former it is the nature of younger people today to passively live and let live and conform to their secondclass standing or worse if inspired to unite around distractive or selfdestructive causes writes levin but the right cause now is nothing short of selfpreservation and there can be no doubt that the new civil rights movement and new generation of activists which must challenge the tyranny of the status quo will be met with entrenched resistance resulting in unease discomfiture risk and ridicule this is a small price to pay for freedom and justice amen with the constitution always as his guide levin explains to the rising generation why the nation’s founding bedrock document is precious and rare as president ronald reagan put it in the constitutions of most governments the government tells the people of those countries what they’re allowed to do in our constitution ‘we the people’ tell the government what it can do that’s a difference worth fighting for

two new military headquarters designed to improve the movement of troops across the atlantic and within europe to counter russia was endorsed at the november numnum meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels one of the planned new nato command centers will be tasked with ensuring the security of \"sea lines of communication\" between north america and europe the other command will \"improve the movement of military forces across europe\" and strengthen logistical functions across nato military commanders would \"flesh out the details\" and present them to defense ministers in febrdate \"this is not only about commands\" said secretary general jens stoltenberg according to him it is vital that european roads bridges and rail networks are able to carry tanks and heavy military equipment \"we are now much more focused on moving heavy equipment across europe\" he explained the locations are due to be chosen next year germany has expressed interest in hosting the logistics base portugal spain france and the united states could be potential hosts for the new atlantic command the ministers also agreed on the creation of a new cyberoperations center to strengthen cyberdefenses and help integrate cybercapabilities into nato planning and operations at all levels nato nations deployed about num troops this year across estonia latvia and lithuania and poland  the alliance members which share borders with russia the nato event coincided in time with the united states house and senate armed services committees’ approval nov8 of the national defense authorization act ndaa for fiscal date the ndaa supports a topline of num billion for national defense—a num billion increase above the president’s combined initial and amended budget requests the ndaa also authorizes num billion for the european deterrence initiative edi to boost military capability to counter russia including accelerating procurement of army prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in europe the bill limits militarytomilitary cooperation with moscow the legislation authorizes num million to provide security assistance to ukraine including defensive lethal weapons num million will be spent on military aid to the baltic states the bill includes the allocation of num million to counter russia’s alleged noncompliance with the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty including a research and development program on a groundlaunched intermediaterange missile which would not place the united states in violation of the treaty secdate of ndaa allows the pentagon to establish a research and development program for a dualcapable roadmobile groundlaunched missile system with a maximum range of num kilometers this is the first step to jettison the treaty true the development of a groundbased midrange missile is not yet a violation but rather a demonstration of intent to do so but once allocated money cannot be wasted the deployment of nato groundbased nucleartipped intermediate forces in the old continent is a european problem as nato allies will become targets for russia’s retaliatory strikes then why should the us tackle it if europeans don’t ask it to do so after all the pretext for development of the missile is the need to defend european allies but no european nato member has asked the us for protection why should the us take the initiative into its hands without european nuclear powers such as the uk and france participating in the program perhaps the situation when europeans fully depend on the us to protect them from russia’s nuclear threat serves the american interests boosting washington’s influence over european affairs with the inf treaty effective no more moscow will be free to deploy intermediaterange missiles without restriction no european nato member has given consent to have the weapons on its territory the decision to develop a groundbased midrange missile may spark a backlash from european allies the deployment of us intermediaterange weapons on the old continent will hit them in the same way the extension of american sanctions on european energy companies runs counter to their economic interests the fact that the ndaa authorizes the development of the weapon banned by the treaty will inevitably impact russia’s military planning true russia and the us have problems with the inf treaty each side accuses the other of noncompliance at the time the general state of the bilateral relations hinders the attempts to find common language on any issue expanding the european deterrence initiative is also not the best way to ease tensions with russia despite that opportunities offered by the special verification commission svc envisioned by the inf treaty are far from being exhausted the parties could use the svc venue to consider additional confidencebuilding measures and information exchanges contemporary technical means of verification make violations impossible to conceal evidence

chiefs and us lawmakers have just taken new steps on the way to making the probability of war an uncomfortably real prospect', 'the return of empires ii part i a world of postmodernism or the newest middle ages the process already taking shape in the world of consolidating «larger spaces» and the return of the empires of bygone eras may not at first glance seem to respond to the spirit of the times however we are living in an age which in view of its uncertainty in peoples minds is indiscriminate to such an extent that it is no stranger to the most improbable policy prescriptions the world is in a state of interregnum in which as zygmunt bauman says «change is the only constant and the unknown  the only certainty» in this world europe remains a battlefield but nowadays the battle is between a westphalian model of sovereign states and new forms of supranational governance… traditional european empires of modern times which is to say the modern age have risen up on the ruins of feudalism however it is a peculiarity of postmodernism that it is ready on a fairly eclectic basis to take on the organisational forms of political relations of any era piracy which was once from times of old remember the famous algerian pirates is today once again firmly establishing itself along the shores of africa a byeffect of course but it has become indicative of a time in which the archaic and the modern intermingle in the most unimaginable way possible this is nothing new however similar era breakdowns have taken place time and again the russian philosopher nikolai berdyaev in his work written between the two world wars entitled «the new middle ages» wrote «we are destined to live in a historical time of era change» berdyaev referred to this time as «the end of new history and the beginning of a new middle ages» defining it as a transition from the rationalism of new history to the irrationalism of a medieval type «the spiritual beginnings of past history are being eliminated its spiritual power exhausted all the usual categories of thought and form of life of the most «advanced» «progressive» even «revolutionary» people of the 19th and 20th centuries are hopelessly outdated and have lost all meaning for the present and especially for the future» according to berdyaevs observations the transition to a new middle ages just the same as the previous transition to an «old» middle ages is accompanied by a noticeable expansion of old societies and the indiscernible addition of new ones «individualism has eliminated all of its possibilities in new history there is no longer any energy left in it the end of the spirit of individualism is the end of new history liberalism democracy parliamentarianism constitutionalism legal formalism humanitarian morals rationalist and empirical philosophy are all the offspring of an individualistic spirit of a humanitarian selfassertiveness and they are all dying away they are all losing their former importance is there much that is ontologically real about stock exchanges banks and money about monstrous factories producing useless objects or weapons for destroying life about superficial luxuries speeches by parliamentarians and lawyers about newspaper articles is there much that is real about the growth of insatiable demands» the russian philosopher noted that christianity had previously played a unifying role for at least a substantial proportion of mankind its very existence «signified an escape from pagan nationalism and particularism» at the end of new history «we are once again seeing before us an unfettered world of pagan particularism inside which there is a deadly battle and destruction taking place» however many of berdyaevs ideas do not seem to be so pertinent these days it would obviously be wrong to place an equals sign between the time in which he wrote and the beginning of the 21st century although the turns of the historical spiral are linked with each other each one is also unique and since the new middle ages has already taken place then in imitation of berdyaev it might be possible to call the trend of our times the newest middle ages one of the most noticeable features of this period for example is the emergence of various complex networks and not just networks of an informationtechnology and sociological nature but also those encompassing relations between states strategies for using network warfare to control nations are extremely popular in washington the pentagon in particular has officially adopted a new military doctrine of netcentric warfare aimed at «superior knowledge» and «information dominance» num at the same time our internationallynetworked world with its apparent independence of individual centres of power which are in fact incorporated into more complex hierarchical relations and interdependencies surprisingly reminds one in an ontological sense of the world of the middle ages in particular a system of multilayered vassalage is forming before our very eyes in which there will no longer be a supreme «liege lord» as before because he cannot and does not want to do it interfering in literally everything to do with the rulers in his area of dominance on the principle of «a vassal of my vassal is not my vassal» washington understands that it is both financially and physically impossible to delve into the particulars of all num world powers but that is exactly what they have been trying to do there so far and with increasing amounts of effort it is simpler to choose half a dozen or a dozen trusted agents «vassals» and entrusttrust them to do it controlling them themselves this is why some of the recent actions of americas close allies first and foremost france are so similar to the principle of distributing feudal lands it is probably possible to talk about a plan for a kind of super empire in place of a sole super power which on the basis of the network principle would be subordinate to the regional or traditional empires currently acquiring a new lease of life the centre would be the same but now it would be more like a coordinator than a straight omnipresent steward it would be considerably more economical and consequently or so the americans are hoping no less efficient full sovereignty meanwhile including the right to military intervention would undoubtedly be centred at the top of this pyramid as the wellknown american academic noam chomsky writes the principles of international order lie in the fact that the united states has the right to use violence whenever they like and nobody else has that right  «of course not well maybe our clients do so they inherit the right other american clients do too but the rights really reside in washington thats what it means to own the world its like the air you breathe you cant question it» num in fact today on a new turn of history a neofeudal system of vassal dependence is reestablishing itself in the world which in its day replaced the mighty rome todays rome is washington which in many ways is in exactly the same state of imperial exhaustion including moral and which in reality is trying to continue its hegemony using exactly the same methods although with the very latest technology but really it makes no different it is only technique and there is nothing new in that neovassalage has a lot of benefits firstly if something is going wrong it is always possible to make it seem like the one responsible is not who is really pulling the strings namely washington but the vassal state using this vassal it is completely possible to deny ones own involvement in the fates of other states and pull on the robes of impartial arbitrator secondly such a mechanism for projecting global power also allows for the costs of managing territories to be kept to a minimum which is rather important given the global financial crisis at the same time while setting about reorganising the world washington also needs to factor in the costs that this would bring at some point the interests of the main liege lord may not coincide with the interests of large vassals capable of obstinacy furthermore those against whom this game is being directed may be in a position to set about strengthening their own alliances the contours of which are already discernible consequently while on the way to putting its plan into action washington still has a number of complex problems to solve to be continued num burgess kennet j organizing for irregular warfare implications for the brigade combat team nаval

both arguments rambukkana so the thing about this is if you’re presenting something like this you have to think about the kind of teaching climate that you’re creating and this is actually these

week the trump administration reversed its previous position and announced they had agreed to supply advanced lethal defensive weapons to the ukrainian government — including the likely delivery of javelin antitank weapons — which could decimate russian armor this is a move sure to be seen in moscow as a drastic escalation that will almost certainly precipitate a russian retaliation russian officials denounced president trump’s authorization of lethal equipment to the ukrainians as an aggressive act meant to deliberately sabotage the minsk peace process the united states has crossed a line by announcing its intention to supply lethal weapons to ukraine russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said saturday us weapons are capable of leading to new casualties in our neighboring country and we cannot remain indifferent to that the decision was framed by the state department as one of assisting ukraine to fight back against russian aggression and was lauded by congressional war hawks as a necessary step to confront what many neocons and cold war relics see as an expansionist russian foreign policy state department spokeswoman heather nauert said the weapons were part of our effort to help ukraine build its longterm defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to deter further aggression proponents of sending the ukrainian government advanced us weapons believe that if they can exact a harsh enough death toll on russian soldiers assisting separatists in the donbas it will force putin to withdraw support for the separatists the insane logic being employed by the west shows little understanding of the psychology of russian president vladimir putin it is simply wishful thinking to believe that a war of attrition on the border of russia will force putin to retreat instead it will precipitate a drastic escalation in russian support one need simply analyze the past few years of war in eastern ukraine to clearly see that moscow is willing to take undertake whatever economic political or military consequences are necessary to prevent the defeat of antikiev separatists in the donbas in num date when ukrainian soldiers and progovernment neonazi battalions were engaging ukrainian separatists in fierce doortodoor housetohouse fighting russia didn’t back down  instead they escalated and forcefully stepped up support  as they supplied not only personnel but tanks supplies and reinforcements to stop kiev’s advances according to daniel depetris a fellow at defense priorities a washington dc thinktank in putin’s mind allowing ukraine to retake strategic territory was an unthinkable prospect that would lead kiev to believe that it could squash the rebellion militarily the infusion of russian troops stopped ukrainian territorial advances in their tracks at considerable human cost to kiev in other words whenever prorussian militants were losing ground or at risk moscow turned on the spigot of assistance to prevent a humiliating defeat or retreat this is one of the biggest reminders to the world community that ukraine’s political disposition is ultimately far more important to russia’s strategic interests than it is to washington’s no amount of us military equipment or heavy weapons systems is likely to eclipse what the russians will provide to the other side to believe russia will be intimidated into withdrawing its troops from ukrainian territory or suing for a peace with a government moscow sees as a puppet of the west just because a few more of its soldiers have been killed is to place hope over the reality of putin’s track record throughout the war whether we in the united states or western europe accept it as legitimate or not putin is highly motivated to preserve russian influence and freedom of movement in a country that shares a nummile border with the russian federation to allow ukraine to drift fully into europe’s orbit on his watch would be nothing short of a personal political humiliation for putin and more important a geopolitical catastrophe for a russia whose political elites remain incredibly nervous about a shrinking near abroad and any hint of political revolution in the former soviet space the decision to provide advanced lethal weaponry to ukraine will be used by moscow as an excuse to increase its support to ukrainian proxies in the breakaway republics of donetsk and luhansk the russian government has operated in virtual lockstep with proxy forces since the western coup to depose then ukrainian president viktor yanukovych although made to look like a spontaneous revolution of the people of ukraine further study in the wake of the euromaidan revealed a plethora of oligarchic forces called fatherland neonazi ukrainian nationalists and shadowy intelligence forces operating in concert with western intelligence agencies to create a perfect storm for a popular revolution in ukraine what appeared on the face to be a popular uprising was in reality nothing more than a wellscripted coup attempt meant to install a prowestern government in ukraine the eastern regions of ukraine with large russian speaking populations refused to recognize this illegitimate government and requested federalization as to maintain a semblance of autonomy from the prowestern regime that took power however the new prowest government refused and instead sent in military forces to occupy the region this precipitated local resistance and russian assistance to the local ukrainian forces fighting to defend their home from the newly installed regime in kiev president trump’s choice to deepen us engagement in a conflict that involves a nonnato country and whose political positioning is largely irrelevant to us policy in europe is a bad decision that has frightening implications regarding the increased potential for conflict with another nuclear superpower in an article for breaking defense  depetris posited numerous compelling unanswered questions that reveal the extremely shortsighted nature of the trump administration’s decision what for instance is the us objective in ukraine other than simply trying to bleed the russians in a proxy conflict when — not if — russia escalates what would the trump administration do to counter it how far is the us willing to go to frustrate moscow’s ambitions in a country it sees as an extension of its former soviet glory what if putin in his desire to respond to what he regards as american aggression in his own backyard seeks to expand the conflict by stirring up promoscow sentiment among the russianspeaking populations of the baltics what would nato do in that situation is nato even prepared for such a contingency and if they are not how is any other eastern european nation supposed to have any confidence in nato when the transatlantic alliance can’t even defend its own members as dmitri trenin director of the carnegie moscow center commented on twitter the

turned every man into a eunuch on top of it but because you start to run out of adults to vicimize so all that’s left is kids the poster child for this is of course zuckerberg and facebook which the founding president of has admitted uses psychological trickery to addict people to the site and now has chosen to abuse children you’d think that when a business starts peddling the equivalent of

know they flagged one of my daughter’s — which featured…… wait for it…… a hike up a hill with her pussy…… cat there was utterly nothing objectionable in any way shape or form in that video but since

remind you that if you tried this you’d be tossed in prison for num years for fraud and the entire set of transactions would be unwound because you cannot structure your finances to avoid paying creditors after the event that gives rise to the liability has happened for example you cannot get into a car accident where you’re at fault and then put your assets in a trust to avoid losing them in the ensuing lawsuit yet that’s exactly what chicago did with goldman’s help to both set it up and run the bond offering this is blatant and outrageous fraud upon every single previous creditor and if

it is extremely common for monopolists to crosssubsidize — that is screw someone else so you think you’re getting a deal it’s illegal irrespective of price rises or not for the precise reason that the

glad you bought a space heater to warm up the place these products are now more energy efficient than in the past with thermostats to turn them off when the home reaches an agreeable temperature they are also not as expensive to run as you’d think because you’re not having to heat multiple rooms the warmth spreads around the home evenly as it radiates out small refrigerator when it comes to the refrigerator there are a good number of choices available you can of course look for a tall refrigerator to take maximum advantage of the height of your home however these units do use considerable amounts of energy a compact refrigerator that might even fit under a welldesigned kitchen counter top is ideal because you can reach it without having to stretch up alternatively installing a refrigerator under the stairs or as part of a wall are other options if you’re really trying to save space and don’t care about the unit being in the kitchen area composting toilet facility having a toilet is a must for most tiny home owners you don’t want to have to rely on local facilities in the dead of night when you get caught short the composting version doesn’t use water and is environmentally friendly it’s easy to empty on a regular basis and doesn’t take up too much space either there’s also no black water tank so it’s more convenient that way too your tiny home doesn’t need too many items to feel comfy but there are some that we’d think are essential to your overall enjoyment you want to avoid adding too many extras in your tiny home as the point is to live small

    "We have done the procedures of first retieving the data from the csv file by using pandas read_csv function. Then we cleaned the data by creating a function that removes all emails, urls, numbers and dates whit use of regular expressions. We could also have cleaned the data by clean-text but we coundn't replace the dates in that function so we used regular expression for everything. Then we tokenized the content by using nltk and created a vocabulary which is the lenght of the list of tokens. After that we removed first stopwords by using nltk again and then stemmed the tokens with also nltk. We counted the words by creating a function count_words that sorts the words into a dictionary from most frequent to least. We did that to the vocabulary with both all words, without stopwords and after stemming. That helped us to find patterns that we can use in Task 3. We illustated the vocabulary using plot from numpy. Lastly we used pandas info function the get some overall info from the dataset and we can another observation for Task 3."

    "For Task 3 we were asked to make 3 non-trival observations in patterns of detecting fake news. We looked at our data from the news_sample dataset which is assuming that most of the data is fake and came up with following. We looked at the most frequent words in the dataset and Presidents and Goverment were both in the top 50 of most frequent words. Mentioned that the most of the articles from the dataset is fake then there could be a pattern of fake news when presidents and goverments are mentioned. The second pattern, we think there could be, is the correlation between unknown author and fake news. In the info about the data we see that there are 170 out of 250 missing an author, so could a missing author be a pattern or indecator for fake news. Last we have the pattern of mentioning the stockmarket and bitcoins. This pattern is build on the same speculation on pattern 1 about goverments and presidents. The stockmarket and bitcoin are in the top 100 most used words in the dataset, so there could be a pattern of fake news there.  "

    "There is also a correlation between politicial and goverment article and fake news. Again we can see that only 23 of 250 articles are labeled politicial, but words like govern, Trump, presid(ent) and Clinton are a few of the top words, which is unlikely to come from only the politicials articles. \n",
    "Lastly we have stock, bitcoin and market which is highly featured in the word cloud. Again assuming, that the words wouldn't be mentioned so frequently in the politicial and reliable articles, that makes out 26 of 250 articles, then it must be used a lot in fake news and therefore could be a pattern."

      " General David Petraeus, the U.S. general who oversees the war in Afghanistan, says the fight for the southern town of Marja — called Operation Moshtarak — is just the first operation in a long campaign.   \n",
      " Petraeus says the battle of Marja is just the beginning. \"This is just the initial operation of what will be a 12- to 18-month campaign, as General [Stanley] McChrystal and his team have mapped it out,\" he said.\n",
      " During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Petraeus said the enemy is formidable. He did not predict how long the operation in Marja, a traditional Taliban stronghold, would continue. He said only that the fighting is tough. \"When we go on the offensive, when we take away sanctuaries and safe havens from the Taliban and the other extremist elements that we and our Afghan and coalition partners are fighting in that country, they are going to fight back. And we are seeing that in Marjah. We will see that in other areas,\" he said.\n",
      " The general spoke from Tampa, Florida, where he heads the U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n",
      " He noted the difficulties encountered in Iraq when former President George W. Bush sent in additional troops in what was called a \"surge.\" Petraeus was asked if, once again, Americans should prepare for significant losses. \"They will be tough. They were tough in Iraq.  Look, I have repeatedly said these types of efforts are hard and they are hard all the time. I do not use words like optimistic or pessimist. I use realist. And the reality is it is hard, but we are there for a very important reason and we cannot forget that,\" he said.\n",
      " So far, 12 NATO troops have died in the offensive. Three others were reported killed in separate, unrelated incidents in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Operation Moshtarak is the largest military action against insurgents since the War in Afghanistan began in 2001 by the United States invasion of the country.\n",
      " —General David Petraeus Petraus was also asked about the military's controversial \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which President Barack Obama has pledged to end. While refusing to comment directly on the policy, Petraus responded by saying stating that he hadn't exerpeinced any problems with gays and lesbians in the military in the past. \"I served, in fact, in combat with individuals who were gay and who were lesbian in combat situations and, frankly, you know, over time you said, ‘Hey, how’s this guy’s shooting?’ Or, ‘How is her analysis?’ or what have you,\" he said.\n",
      " The general also noted his opposition to torture saying, \"Whenever we have, perhaps, taken expedient measures, they have turned around and bitten us in the backside.\" He added, \"We end up paying a price for it ultimately. Abu Ghraib and other situations like that are non-biodegradable. They don’t go away. The enemy continues to beat you with them like a stick.\"\n",
      " Meanwhile, the Obama administration's Afghanistan strategy got a vote of confidence Sunday from retired General Colin Powell, who served as President Bush's Secretary of State during his first term in office.\n",
      " Powell said it is a good, comprehensive plan. But at the same time, he acknowledged he has concerns about whether or not the Afghan government can follow-up once the NATO operation pushes the Taliban out. \"I hope their capability will increase. The Afghan National Army is improved but clearly not up to U.S. standards yet. And the police force - they have a lot to prove, they do not yet have the confidence of the people,\" he said.\n",
      " Powell was interviewed on the CBS television program Face the Nation.\n",

Now we were able to get the content from the links with request and beautifulsoup.

Then we opened those links by for loop and extracted the text in the articles by using find all p tags and then append the text to a list. Because of the links nested into the text, we had to place all elements of the list of strings that we got from the p tags in the article in a new list where it was joined by the function join.
